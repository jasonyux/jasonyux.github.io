    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Hermann von Helmholtz was one of the first to collect <strong>empirical data</strong> associated with the nervous system and behavior. Example of this empirical data was “reaction time”.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>data that is <strong><em>well controlled and objective</em></strong></li>
          <li>reaction time =&gt; time between a stimulus to an action</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Wilhelm Wundt &amp; Edward Titchener believed that scientific study of Psychology should <strong>focus on</strong> <strong>structuralism</strong>, or breaking down of elements that constitute the mind; “<strong><em>anatomy of the mind</em></strong>”.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>William James believed that the scientific study of psychology should <strong>focus on</strong> <strong>functionalism</strong>, or how the mind enables people to adapt to their environments. This incorporates <strong><em>understanding behaviors</em></strong>.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Imagine that in a high school chemistry class, the teacher asks her students for the best way to define water. One student, Mike, says that the way to define water is to break it into its basic components; he defines it as two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. His classmate, Susan, disagrees with him, and says that the best way to define water is to look at its purpose. She describes it as a liquid without taste or color that serves as the main component of lakes, rivers, oceans, and streams, as well as the fluids in most living organisms, including human beings. Mike’s definition is closely aligned with that of <strong>structuralism</strong>, while Susan’s definition demonstrates the principles of <strong>functionalism</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="general-procedure">General Procedure</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Decide on a <strong>research question/topic</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>that will help determine the scientific prediction to be experimentally tested</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Conduct a <strong>thorough search in the peer reviewed scientific articles</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>to see what is currently published, thus what is known, or not known, about your research question/topic</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Formulate a <strong>hypothesis</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>which is formulating an experimentally testable statement of your scientific prediction</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Design</strong> an experimental methodology to experimentally test the hypothesis you have formulated</li>
  <li>Before implementing the designed experimental methodology, <strong>obtain institutional approval</strong> (ethical purposes)</li>
  <li>Once institutional approval is obtained, implement the experimental methodology
    <ul>
      <li>collect data and <strong><em>consistently</em></strong></li>
      <li>analyze the data <strong><em>consistently</em></strong></li>
      <li>interpret and write up the data <strong><em>consistently</em></strong> present the data
        <ul>
          <li><strong><em>consistently</em></strong> refers to including all the data you obtained, even if it falsifies your theory</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Publish the results from the data in a <strong>peer reviewed</strong> journal!!!</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="methodology">Methodology</h3>

<p>Scientific research in Psychology generally includes the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>independent variable</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>mostly <strong><em>manipulated by the experimenter</em></strong>, and not directly manipulated by other variables within the experimental methodology</li>
      <li>this needs to be truly <strong>independent, changing/related to only one factor</strong> at a time in the experiment</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>dependent variable</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong><em>measured</em></strong> by the experimenter, and this can be the <strong><em>outcome</em></strong> due to the independent variable, thus an indirect assessment of the experimenter’s manipulation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>control group of human participants</strong>, or <strong>control group of animal subjects</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>the group that is <strong><em>not exposed to the independent variable</em></strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>experimental group of human participants</strong>, or <strong>experimental group of animal subjects</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>the group that is <strong><em>exposed to the independent variable</em></strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="datadiagrams">Data/Diagrams</h3>

<p>Some data could be better represented by Bar Graphs:</p>

<p>Sometimes, scatter plots:</p>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20200915160401206.png" alt="image-20200915160401206" style="zoom:67%;" /></p>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Flawed Example</p>

    <p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20200915160954612.png" alt="image-20200915160954612" /></p>

    <p>where</p>

    <ul>
      <li>it is flawed because the <strong>independent variable</strong> in this case should be randomized: a bird could be responsive to the first image <strong><em>being an image</em></strong>, not the fact that it is a predator
        <ul>
          <li>namely, it does not only relate to one “factor” of the experiment</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Good Example</p>

    <p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20200915161415720.png" alt="image-20200915161415720" /></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>its data are also supporting the hypothesis</p>

        <p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20200915161525439.png" alt="image-20200915161525439" /></p>

        <ul>
          <li>supportive, if there is the assumption is true <strong>being anxious means walking around less</strong>. See below section.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="validity-of-results">Validity of Results</h3>

<p>This does not talk about whether if your results are “correct”, but if they are <strong>really related</strong> to your experiment, as there are potential <strong><em>many factors being changed when you manipulate an independent variable</em></strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>internal validity</strong> – degree to which the relationship being tested is trustworthy and <strong><em>not influenced by other factors or variables (if your independent variable is well controlled)</em></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>e.g. in the above example, is movement time only affected by the Kpas4?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>construct validity</strong> – degree to which the variables of the experimental methodology <strong><em>measure what they are supposed to measure</em></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>e.g. in the above example, is movement time in an open field a good measure of anxiety?  What if there are disabilities caused by knockout of Kpas4 that also affects movement time =&gt; measuring disability? What if it makes them more tired =&gt; measuring tiredness?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>external validity</strong> – degree to which the results of the experimental methodology can be <strong><em>generalized</em></strong> to the “real world”
    <ul>
      <li>e.g. how results of mice can be generalized to human</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="experimental-methodologies">Experimental Methodologies</h3>

<p>Basically, ways of collecting data:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>case study</strong> – experimenter intensively observes, describes, and documents the observations and descriptions of a “unique” participant or participants
    <ul>
      <li>so participants are <strong>aware of being experimented</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>naturalistic observation</strong> – experimenter is passively, usually separated from what they are observing, to ensure that they are not altering the environment of what they are observing
    <ul>
      <li>participants are <strong>not aware of being experimented</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>self-reports</strong> – experimenter administers surveys or questionnaires, or interviews, to participants
    <ul>
      <li>those surveys have to be well-designed</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>However, there are some common caveats in those methodologies:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>confounding variable</strong>(s) – extraneous part(s) of the experimental methodology, usually <strong><em>out of the experimenter’s ability to eliminate/control</em></strong>, that may affect the outcome</li>
  <li><strong>reactivity</strong> – if a human <strong><em>participant knows their behaviors are being observed</em></strong> as part of the experimental methodology, that participant may alter their behaviors
    <ul>
      <li>the <strong><em>placebo effect</em></strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>experimenter expectancy effect</strong> – due to expectations of the experimenter, the experimenters themselves may not be aware that <strong><em>their expectations are altering the experimental methodology</em></strong> to fulfill their own expectations</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ethics">Ethics</h3>

<p>Before doing the experiments mentioned above, they need to be approved by either:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Institutional Review Board (IRB)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>for <strong>human participants</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>for <strong>animal participants</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In general, for an experiment to be ethical, you need to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Experimental methodology should be designed to <strong><em>minimize harm/pain/distress</em></strong> (humans, animals) and to ensure more benefit than risk</li>
  <li>Informed consent – <strong><em>fully informed of the nature of the research</em></strong>; potential risks and benefits; confidentiality; <strong><em>right to withdrawal at any time</em></strong></li>
  <li>Use of human deception - those who volunteer to be part of an experiment have the right to know what will happen to them during the course of the entire experiment; if justified, <strong><em>humane deception</em></strong> can be used, but experimenter(s) should <strong><em>debrief the participants after experimental participation</em></strong>’
    <ul>
      <li>to help with <em>naturalistic observation</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong><em>Vulnerable populations</em></strong> should be treated with <strong><em>special care and implementations</em></strong> - ensures thoughtful decisions on behalf of the participants as to whether or not to participate in the proposed scientific research</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="anatomy-of-nervous-system">Anatomy of Nervous System</h2>

<p>Suppose you are asked to raise your right hand. What happens to your brain that causes your movements?</p>

<ol>
  <li>your brain processes the request</li>
  <li>your brain parse what is needed to respond to it</li>
  <li>your brain sends a signal to the muscle of your right hand</li>
  <li>right hand raises</li>
</ol>

<p>In short, <strong>your brain/mind/thoughts have altered some area of your blood flow</strong> such that you behave what you are behaving.</p>

<h3 id="terminologies">Terminologies</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>neuroaxis</strong> for humans
    <ul>
      <li><strong><em>imaginary “line”</em></strong> which spans the “midline” of all the segments of the spinal cord, up and through the “midline” of the brain</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Ipsilateral</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>denotes anatomical structures located on the <strong><em>same side of the body</em></strong>, with respect to the neuroaxis

<p>In everyday life, all biological cells of our central nervous system (<strong>CNS</strong>), and, all biological cells of our peripheral nervous system (<strong>PNS</strong>), <strong><em>work together</em></strong> for the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>processing of incoming, <strong>afferent (sensory)</strong> information; this process <strong><em>originates</em> <em>from</em> the PNS to the CNS</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>e.g., when you <em>hear</em> that you need to raise your right hand</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>processing of outgoing, <strong>efferent (motor)</strong> information; this process <strong><em>originates from</em> the CNS to the PNS</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>e.g. actually raising your right hand</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>processing of <strong>sensorimotor</strong> information
    <ul>
      <li>e.g. combining the above two, happening almost synchronously</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="anatomy-of-cns-and-pns-cells">Anatomy of CNS and PNS Cells</h4>

<p>They all have the <strong>same anatomical structures</strong></p>

<p>For example, when you want to raise your right hand:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Your brain</strong> changes the blood/current flow around the cell, which changes the electrical potential</li>
  <li>Proteins sensitive to changes in voltage would open</li>
  <li>Net influx of ions into the cell</li>
  <li><strong>Activates this biological cell</strong>, and it is the beginning of everything</li>

<h4 id="difference-between-cns-and-pns-cells">Difference between CNS and PNS Cells</h4>

<p>Even if they have the same structure, they have <strong>different names</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>CNS cells</strong> are called <strong>neurons</strong></li>
  <li><strong>PNS cells</strong> are called <strong>nerves</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This is because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>neurons</strong> are all situated in the brain and the spinal chord</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>nerves</strong> always have <strong><em>part</em></strong> of the axon located <strong>outside brain/spinal chord</strong></p>

    <p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20200922010913455.png" alt="image-20200922010913455" style="zoom:67%;" /></p>

    <p>where:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>we have <strong>afferent nerves</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>where cell body is outside the CNS, terminals inside</li>
          <li>are <strong>afferent</strong>, since they gets information <strong>from the outside</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>we have <strong>efferent nerves</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>where cell body is inside the CNS, terminals outside</li>
          <li>are <strong>efferent</strong>, since they gets information <strong>from the inside</strong> CNS</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>there are also <strong>cranial nerves</strong> and <strong>spinal nerves</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>see the section <a href="#Cranial Nerves and Spinal Nerves">Cranial Nerves and Spinal Nerves</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>we see that each cell has at least <strong>part of the axon</strong> (轴突) <strong>being outside the CNS</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>probably because it needs the information from and to the CNS to work correctly. e.g it processes afferent information and needs to carry it to the CNS</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Extension:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>the actual <strong>mechanism</strong> of how <strong>information is transmitted from a nerve to a neuron</strong> is:
      <ol>
        <li>Usually the begins in the cell body area, where receptors on the dendrites open up</li>
        <li>Inflow of ions affect charge density/voltage</li>
        <li>Triggers release of chemical at axon terminal, which is usually inside the CNS</li>
        <li>Those chemicals bind to the neurons in CNS, and activates the receptors there</li>

<p>Cranial(颅) nerves tend to be located <strong>at the level of the brain</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>hence <strong><em>above the spinal nerves</em></strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for example, related to your nose, eyes, tongues, neck</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Spinal nerves tend to be located <strong>at the level of spinal chord</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>hence <strong><em>below the cranial nerves</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="autonomic-nervous-system-of-pns">Autonomic Nervous System of PNS</h3>

<p>An <strong>autonomic nervous system is</strong> a system, without conscious direction, regulates important bodily functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, pupil dilation, body temperature, sweating and digestion.</p>

<ul>
  <li>basically they control neurons, which control these different physical reactions by directing the action of skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle and gland secretion.</li>
</ul>

<p>This system allows animals to <strong><em>make quick internal adjustments and react without having to think about it</em></strong>.</p>

<p>The entire system is made of two parts: <strong>sympathetic nervous system</strong> and <strong>parasympathetic nervous system</strong>.</p>

<p>And here, we are also reminded of the fact that <strong><em>CNS and PNS work together</em></strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>sympathetic nervous system</strong> is the nervous system that <strong><em>expends body’s stored energy</em></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>“fight-or-flight” response is driven by the sympathetic nervous system, a normally harmonized network of brain structures.</li>
      <li>basically where our body <strong><em>internally forces us to either fight or flight</em></strong></li>
      <li><strong><em>“activated” by a stressor</em></strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>parasympathetic nervous system</strong> is the nervous system that <strong><em>increases body’s energy</em></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>basically our body <strong><em>internally forces us to rest and restore</em></strong></li>
      <li><strong><em>“activated” by a stressor being gone</em></strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>For example</em></strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Scenario</strong>:</p>

    <p>You are walking alone in the midnight of a dark alley, you hear footsteps behind you coming up. You got really nervous. After a few seconds, he walked passed you. You got relieved.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Analysis</strong>:</p>

    <p>Your body activated the <em>fight or flight</em> response of the sympathetic nervous system due to the <strong>stressor of:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>you receive afferent information of being in a dark surrounding, and hearing footsteps</li>
      <li>you receive bad/stressful memory from your brain from the CNS of being alone at midnight</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And your body activated <strong>sympathetic nervous system</strong>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>activated cranial nerves of the PNS
        <ul>
          <li>which makes you become concentrated in sensing surrounding information</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>activated neurons in the brain/spinal chord</li>
      <li>activated neurons in the spinal chord activate spinal nerves (PNS)
        <ul>
          <li>those spinal nerves release chemicals to increase activation of biological cells
            <ul>
              <li>hence heart-beat pumping up and etc</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>However, when the man passed by, the <strong>stressor is gone</strong>. And your body activated <strong>parasympathetic nervous system:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>the same process as above, but in the end spinal nerves release chemicals to decrease activation of biological cells</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<p>and they took the <strong>circled part (axon of neuron)</strong> and measured their electric potential <strong>in vitro (outside the squid body)</strong>:</p>

<p>where they found:</p>

<ul>
  <li>At rest, or when the neuron is not disturbed, <strong>the inside of the neuron (intracellular fluid) is negatively charged (-70 mV)</strong> <strong><em>with respect to</em></strong> the outside of the neuron (extracellular fluid).

      <li>This is known as the <strong>neuron’s resting potential</strong>. This is in fact the <strong>same in human</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="forces-contributing-to-the-resting-potential">Forces Contributing to the Resting Potential</h4>

<p>Basically, what caused the (negative) resting potential.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Force of diffusion</strong> - when there are <em>no forces or barriers to prevent</em> them from doing so, molecules will <strong>diffuse</strong> from regions where they are more concentrated to regions where they are less concentrated</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Force of electrostatic pressure</strong> - cations (+) are “pushed away” from regions with an excess of cations (+), and anions (-) are “pushed away” from regions with an excess of anions (-)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

  <li><strong>forces and their directions</strong>

      <li>are indicated by arrows. For example, for the $K+$ ion inside the neuron, <strong>force is balanced</strong>.</li>
      <li>for $Na+$ outside the cell and the $K-$ inside the cell, <strong>forces are not balanced</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And for those two unbalanced force, this is because there is actually another contributing force in the cell:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>This sodium potassium (Na+K+) pump is embedded in the membrane of the entire neuron</li>

      <li><strong>a transient undershoot of its resting potential</strong>, so that the electrical potential of the intracellular fluid of this neuron is decreased to voltages even less than this neuron’s resting potential</li>

  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="real-mechanism-of-neuron-activation">Real Mechanism of Neuron Activation</h3>

<p>Now we know that when the voltage inside the cell gets above a certain threshold, all the interesting things (<strong>action potential</strong>) happen. In real life, this is what <strong>action potential do:</strong></p>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20200924132202242.png" alt="image-20200924132202242" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>When the <strong>receptors</strong> or channels embedded in the membrane of the dendrites <strong>open</strong>, there will be an <strong>influx of cations</strong> (positively charged ions such as <strong>Na+</strong>) from the neuron’s extracellular fluid going into the neuron’s intracellular fluid
    <ul>
      <li>remember from the section <a href="#Forces Contributing to the Resting Potential">Forces Contributing to the Resting Potential</a>, we have <strong>lots of Na+ trying to come in</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Summation of the electrical potentials from the influx of cations (Na+) <strong>occur at the axon hillock</strong></li>
  <li>If summation of the electrical potentials from the <strong>influx of cations (Na+) at the axon hillock reaches the threshold of excitation for this neuron</strong>, an <strong>action potential occurs</strong> and travels <strong>down the axon</strong> of this neuron
    <ul>
      <li>i.e. if the summation of cations <strong>increased the electrical potential (depolarization)</strong> inside the cell to <strong>above the threshold</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>action potential - the brief <strong>electrochemical event</strong> of a neuron that travels from the cell body area of the neuron to the axon terminals (terminal buttons) of the same neuron (all or none)
    <ul>
      <li>this basically acts as <strong>sending information to the rest the cells</strong> in your body</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Graphically, this is what happened in a real cell</strong></p>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20200929134440683.png" alt="image-20200929134440683" /></p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“afterhyperpolarization aka hyperpolarization” is due to K+ channels <strong><em>not closing immediately</em></strong>, even after the neuron’s resting potential is reached.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="role-of-myelin-sheath">Role of Myelin Sheath</h4>

<p>Myelin sheath on the axon acts as an <strong>electric insulator</strong> for the conduction of those electricity.</p>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20200929143322611.png" alt="image-20200929143322611" /></p>

<p>where, <strong>with myelin sheath</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reduces the ability of any electrical potential to leak out at the myelinated parts of the axon, thus <strong>increases the conduction velocity</strong> of the action potential</li>
  <li>much less influx of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Na+</code> is needed to enter the neuron for these retriggered action potentials 为了延续这个potential (because the neuron is already depolarized). Therefore, <strong>less energy is needed for these action potentials to reach the axon terminals</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="real-life-application---bmi-brain-machine-interface">Real Life Application - BMI (Brain Machine Interface)</h3>

<p><strong>Now</strong>, this means you can record the <strong><em>electric potential pattern</em></strong> in your brain (motor cortex) for any given action, and then program it such that:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>when that pattern</strong> is observed, the robotic arm would do that corresponding action</li>
  <li>this means you can control robotic arms “<strong>remotely</strong>” with electrodes planted in your brain detecting for electric potential</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, a sample image looks like</p>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20200929142126688.png" alt="image-20200929142126688" style="zoom: 50%;" /></p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <strong>redline</strong> would be the $0$ potential</li>
  <li>everything to the left hand side of the finger would be the <strong>resting potential</strong></li>
  <li>there is an <strong>action potential</strong> to the right of the finger, whose spike exceeds the positive $0V$</li>
  <li>your <strong>brain can somehow control /generate electric potentials</strong></li>

<h2 id="anatomy-of-a-synapse">Anatomy of a Synapse</h2>

<p><strong>Synapses</strong> are the <strong>sites of transmission of electric nerve impulses</strong> between two nerve cells (neurons) or between a neuron and a gland or muscle cell (effector).</p>

<p>Essentially, it refers to an area:</p>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20200929144109732.png" alt="image-20200929144109732" /></p>

<p>where it is composed of:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Axon terminal</strong> of the <strong>presynaptic</strong> neuron</li>
  <li><strong>Dendrites</strong> of a neighboring <strong>postsynaptic</strong> neuron</li>
  <li><strong>Extracellular fluid</strong> in between</li>
</ul>

<p>And when the action potential travels down the axon of the presynaptic neuron, <strong><em>neurotransmitters</em></strong> are released to <strong>bind to and open the receptors postsynaptic neuron</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>and it is with those endogenous <strong>neurotransmitters</strong> that we continued or neurotic signal</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="neurotransmitters">Neurotransmitters</h3>

<p>Some roles/properties of a neurotransmitter:</p>

<ol>
  <li>must be synthesized/produced <strong>within the neuron</strong></li>
  <li>have the capability to be <strong>released from the presynaptic neuron</strong> when an action potential occurs</li>
  <li><strong>activate channels, and/or specific receptors</strong>, both of which are embedded in the membranes of dendrites of the postsynaptic neuron.
    <ul>
      <li>it the end, it will result in the depolarization, and/or an action potential, of this postsynaptic neuron</li>

<h2 id="consciousness">Consciousness</h2>

<p><strong>Consciousness</strong> are the states of awareness of one’s cognitions, and one’s environment.</p>

<ul>
  <li>we can experience and exhibit <strong>various states of consciousness</strong> (e.g. high state of consciousness during exams, low state during sleep)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="circadian-rhythm">Circadian Rhythm</h3>

<p>All of our states of consciousness can occur within our <strong>circadian rhythm</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Circadian rhythms are <strong><em>24-hour cycles that are part of the body’s internal clock</em></strong>, running in the background to carry out essential functions and processes. One of the most important and well-known circadian rhythms is the sleep-wake cycle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><em>Different systems of the body follow circadian rhythms that are synchronized with a master clock in the brain.</em></strong> This master clock is directly influenced by environmental cues, especially light, which is why circadian rhythms are tied to the cycle of day and night.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="extension-onset-and-offset-of-sleep">Extension: Onset and Offset of Sleep</h4>

<p>The parts of the brain that is responsible to sleep are the follows:</p>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20200929152154152.png" alt="image-20200929152154152" /></p>

<p>The onset and offset of sleep is a <strong>culmination of many different events</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>retinohypothalamic pathway</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>retina/your eyes</strong> sends information to the suprachiasmatic nuclei of your <strong>hypothalamus</strong> regarding the amount of light in the external environment (via the suppression/activation of a hormone, melatonin, done <strong>by pineal gland</strong></li>
      <li>the suprachiasmatic nuclei use this information to coordinate circadian rhythms with the solar day</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>circadian “oscillators”</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>networks of biochemical feedback loops that <strong>generate 24-hour rhythms in organisms</strong> from bacteria to animals. The oscillator <strong>cycles with a stable phase and is synchronized with solar time</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>differences in large scale/overall field <strong>electrical potentials of the brain</strong></li>
  <li><strong>dreams</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>a phenomenon that <strong>combines different states of consciousness during sleep</strong>, if verbally recalled during wakefulness, this verbal recall can be considered a behavioral event</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="extension-sleep-experiments">Extension: Sleep Experiments</h4>

<p>Sleep experiments are usually conducted within sleep labs, which contains:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bedroom (or bedrooms) adjacent to an <strong>observation room</strong></li>
  <li>Experimenter prepares the subject for <strong>measurements</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Electroencephalogram (EEG)</li>
      <li>Electromyogram (EMG)</li>
      <li>Electro-oculogram (EOG)</li>
      <li>Other transducing devices</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All the above allows us to <strong>assess physiological events associated with sleep</strong></p>

<h4 id="electroencephalogram-eeg">Electroencephalogram (EEG)</h4>

<p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a <strong>non-invasive biological procedure</strong> that places multiple electrodes along one’s scalp to measure and <strong>record the large scale field electrical potentials of the brain</strong> (EEG recordings are not recordings of strictly action potentials)</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>large scale field electrical potential $\neq$ action potentials</strong>, as they are non-invasive, they are just detecting the overall voltage of parts of your brain, therefore <strong>including action potential</strong> <strong><em>+ potential from extracellular fluid</em></strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="braineeg-waves">Brain/EEG Waves</h4>

<p><strong>Brain waves</strong> basically refer to the waves you see in an EEG, which comes from <strong>oscillations of your large scale electric potential</strong>.</p>

<p>In general, we have <strong><em>five types/rhythms of brain waves</em></strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Delta</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>slowest brain waves associated with deep/dreamless sleep</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Theta</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>slightly faster waves, associated with being in a drowsy state</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Alpha</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>arising in the occipital lobe (associated with vision processing), being wakeful rest</li>
      <li>comparatively more aware of oneself, rather than surrounding</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Beta</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>normal wakeful consciousness</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Gamma</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>normal visual consciousness</li>
      <li>high cognition</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Notice:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all of the above occurs in our circadian rhythm. This means that they can <strong>occur during the day and/or during our sleep</strong></li>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>alpha</strong> is not in the normal cycle of sleep, but the rest is</li>
  <li><strong>deep sleep</strong> is often referred to as <strong>SWS (slow wave sleep)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>SWS</strong> is thought to be important for <strong>memory consolidation</strong></li>
      <li>dream can also occur during SWS as well</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>REM sleep</strong> is usually the most useful dreams
    <ul>

<h5 id="rem-sleeping">REM Sleeping</h5>

<ul>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Lucid dreaming (see definition below)
    <ul>
      <li>as compared with non-lucid dreaming during SWS</li>
      <li>high awareness of one’s own cognition while one is in the sleep cycle</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Skeletal muscle paralysis (a form of atonia)
    <ul>
      <li>as compared to none during SWS</li>
      <li>basically muscle has lost its strength</li>
      <li><strong><em>therefore, you cannot easily act out of your dreams</em></strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Lucid Dream:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>There are in fact <strong>two states of lucid dream</strong>:
      <ol>
        <li><strong>primary state of consciousness associated with lucid dreaming</strong> – high awareness of <strong><em>one’s own cognition</em></strong> while one is undergoing the lucid dream</li>
        <li><strong>secondary state of consciousness associated with lucid dreaming</strong> – high awareness of <strong><em>one’s own cognition that one is in fact dreaming</em></strong>, while one is undergoing the lucid dream
          <ul>
            <li>experimentally, it is found that this <strong>only occurs during gamma waves</strong></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice, the above definition means that:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>promoting gamma brain activity during REM sleep may help to restore dysfunctional neural network connectivity</em>, so that you can more easily <em>distinguish reality vs non-reality</em> even if you are awake</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="drug">Drug</h3>

<p><strong>Another state of consciousness that is altered/not natural</strong> (hence unlike the circadian rhythm)</p>

<p>However, the exact definition of a drug is amorphous. Because it could also depend on the intention of the one taking it, and etc.</p>

<p>Here, we are just focusing on those <strong>drugs and their effects in changing our circadian rhythm/normal behavior.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>agonists drugs</strong> can serve as a <strong><em>“precursor” for the synthesis of a neurotransmitter in the presynaptic neuron</em></strong>, therefore, increasing the molecules of this neurotransmitter so that these molecules can be released into the synaptic cleft
    <ul>
      <li>for example, dopamine</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>antagonist drugs</strong> <strong><em>inactivate an enzyme (protein) for the synthesis of a neurotransmitter</em></strong> in the <strong><em>presynaptic neuron</em></strong>, therefore, decreasing the molecules of this neurotransmitter so that these molecules cannot be released into the synaptic cleft
    <ul>
      <li>for example, serotonin</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>agonist drugs</strong> that binds to a <strong><em>neurotransmitter’s receptors on the presynaptic neuron to block this receptor</em></strong>, so that this neurotransmitter <strong><em>will not be “re-uptaken” back</em></strong> ; therefore, <strong><em>more molecules of this neurotransmitter will be released into the synaptic cleft</em></strong> to allow greater influx of cations, and/or influx of anions, into its postsynaptic neuron
    <ul>
      <li>this is the tricky one</li>
      <li>for example, cocaine</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>antagonist drugs</strong> binds to <strong><em>receptors on the postsynaptic neuron</em></strong> to not allow the influx of cations, and/or influx of anions, into this postsynaptic neuron

<p>Therefore, <strong>what you perceive, then, is vastly different from the pattern of stimulation your eyes are taking in</strong> (for example).  In fact, most of the computations the brain performs never reach your consciousness. Only important new outcomes do.</p>

<h3 id="psychophysics">Psychophysics</h3>

<p><strong>Psychophysics</strong> are procedures that <strong>measure the <em>intensity</em> of an environmental stimulus</strong>, and a person’s ability to detect this intensity</p>

<ul>
  <li>in fact, one of the goals of psychophysics is to <strong>determine how much (threshold) of the environmental stimulus is required to evoke (or bring forth) a sensory signal</strong> that is biologically processed by humans</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, those <strong><em>intensities</em></strong> could be measures of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Just Noticeable Difference (JND)</li>
  <li>Absolute Threshold</li>
  <li>Sensory Adaptation</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="just-noticeable-difference-jnd">Just Noticeable Difference (JND)</h3>

<p>JND – when comparing different intensities of an environmental stimulus, the JND is the <strong><em>minimal change in intensity</em> of this environmental stimulus that is needed for <em>detecting this different intensity</em></strong></p>

\[\frac{\Delta I}{I} \equiv k\]

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$I$ is the intensity of the <strong>original environmental stimulus</strong></li>
  <li>$\Delta I$ is the <strong>difference in intensity</strong> between the comparison environmental stimulus and the original environmental stimulus</li>
  <li>$k$ <strong>remains constant</strong>, despite variations in $I$
    <ul>
      <li>e.g. for sound, it is usually $k=0.1$</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>if the difference in intensity is <strong>equal or larger than the minimum intensity $\Delta I$,</strong> then <strong>this is the <em>difference threshold,</em> or the <em>JND</em>, <em>for this particular change in stimulus</em> to be detected</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="absolute-threshold">Absolute Threshold</h3>

<p>Absolute Threshold - the <strong>“minimum” intensity of the environmental stimulus</strong> needed for sensory transduction to occur (activation of first order neurons in senses).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Experimenters have derived the absolute threshold</strong> from participants’ reporting of their ability to <strong>correctly detect the presence of an environmental stimulus <em>50% of the time</em></strong> this environmental stimulus was presented</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example:</p>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201006164317288.png" alt="image-20201006164317288" /></p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>remember that threshold is dependent on $50\%$ chances of successful detection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>this could obviously <strong>vary between people</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>e.g. for autisms with huge sensory overload, their absolute threshold would be much lower than ours.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sensory-adaptation">Sensory Adaptation</h3>

<p>Sensory adaptation is when there is a <strong>sustained presentation of an environmental stimulus</strong> at <strong><em>high intensity</em></strong>, yet the <strong>neural activity</strong> of the sense associated with this sustained presentation <strong>decreases with time</strong></p>

<h4 id="mechanism-of-sensory-adaptation">Mechanism of Sensory Adaptation</h4>

<p>First, we need to understand <strong>how neurotransmitters are <em>released</em></strong> into the synaptic cleft:</p>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201013130224330.png" alt="image-20201013130224330" /></p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Vesicles</strong> contain molecules of neurotransmitters, and are located in this presynaptic neuron</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When an action potential is going down the axon of a presynaptic neuron, $Ca^{2+}$ channels embedded in the membrane of the axon terminals <strong>open to allow an influx of $Ca^{2+}$ from the extracellular fluid</strong> (synaptic cleft), into the intracellular fluid of this presynaptic neuron</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This <strong>influx of $Ca^{2+}$</strong> into this presynaptic neuron will <strong>help its vesicles to dock and fuse with the membrane</strong> of its axon terminal, therefore, <strong>releasing the contents of its neurotransmitter molecules into the synaptic cleft</strong> to activate the postsynaptic neuron</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Now, sensory adaptation happens because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sensory adaptation is the sustained <strong>rapid firing of action potentials</strong> due to the presentation of the sustained environmental stimulus</li>
  <li>
    <p>This leads to the presynaptic neuron’s <strong>inability to influx any more $Ca^{2+}$</strong> because action potentials are firing too rapidly</p>
  </li>
  <li>Therefore, no more $Ca^{2+}$ can enter this presynaptic neuron, so that the vesicles of this presynaptic neuron cannot dock and fuse with the membrane of its axon terminal, therefore, there will be <strong>no release of the vesicle’s neurotransmitter molecules</strong> into the extracellular fluid (synaptic cleft)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note:</p>

  <ul class="task-list">
    <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Basically, lacking $Ca^{2+}$ in the blood concentration will cause difficulties for vesicles to release those <strong>neurotransmitters</strong>. But also notice that <strong>lacking $Ca^{2+}$ has nothing to do with being able to fire action potential</strong> or not.</li>
    <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Why does this not work with vision? Why, when we fixate our eyes on some images, those images don’t get adapted and disappear?
      <ul>
        <li>due to the presence of saccade and micro saccade of eyes movement</li>
        <li>A <strong>saccade</strong> is a quick, simultaneous <strong>movement of both eyes</strong> between two or more phases of fixation in the same direction. A <strong>micro saccade</strong> is basically a miniature version of the saccade movement.
          <ul>
            <li>as a result, you <strong>never truly fixate at something</strong> when you look at them</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

<h4 id="receptive-fields-of-neurons">Receptive Fields of Neurons</h4>

<p><strong>Receptive fields of neurons</strong> are <strong>area</strong>(s) on a body surface, (eg., skin, tongue), or area(s) in space, (eg., visual field, auditory field), in which <strong>stimulus applied to those area(s) will elicit a response from a neuron</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>i.e. it provides a description of the <strong><em>location at which a sensory stimulus must be presented in order to elicit a response</em></strong> from a sensory cell</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>this also means that, the more receptive a neuron is to that area, the stronger the response will be</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="example-measuring-the-neurons-response-in-a-receptive-field">Example: Measuring the Neuron’s Response in a Receptive Field</h5>

<p>Here, we are measuring how a neuron respond to stimulus in a <strong>visual receptive field</strong>. <strong>Visual field</strong> is the area in space one <strong><em>sees without movement of one’s eyes or head</em></strong> (complies with previous definition).</p>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201015155153263.png" alt="image-20201015155153263" style="zoom: 67%;" /></p>

<p>and by measuring the response of <strong>a certain neuron</strong>, we see</p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the $V1$ neuron that gets measured responded the most to the vertical bar, which also means that the <strong>receptive field of that neuron could be that vertical bar exactly</strong>.
    <ul>
      <li>Therefore, other slanted bars will receive a <strong>lower response due to lower area lying in the receptive field of that $V1$ neuron</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="principlesurround-receptive-fields">Principle/Surround Receptive Fields</h5>

<p><strong>Principal receptive field</strong> of a <strong>neuron</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a neuron’s <strong><em>most preferred</em> area</strong>(s) on a body surface, or in space, as indicated by the neuron’s most increased responsiveness, <em>when compared with</em> this neuron’s less responsiveness to activation(s) of other area(s)
    <ul>
      <li>so placing the vertical bar in the principle receptive field of a neuron will elicit a larger response than placing it on a surround receptive neuron</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Surround receptive field</strong> of a <strong>neuron</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a neuron’s <strong><em>less preferred</em> area</strong>(s) on a body surface, or in space, as indicated by the neuron’s decreased responsiveness <em>when compared with</em> the neuron’s principal receptive field</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Experimentally</strong>, we tend to map the receptive fields of neurons in the brain by presenting stimuli that are sensory modality specific, however, one neuron can have <strong>many principal, and many surround, receptive fields</strong>, to not just one modality, but also to different modalities</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="excitation-and-inhibition">Excitation and Inhibition</h4>

<p>Basically, this is about how <strong>higher order neurons filters out incoming excitations passed in by first order neurons</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Inhibitory inputs</strong>, along with <strong>excitatory inputs</strong>, to neurons, are working together all the time so that incoming sensory information doesn’t overload us. This is also called the <strong><em>balance of excitation and inhibition</em></strong> a neuron receives</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This balance of excitation and inhibition allows for proper <strong>sensory gating</strong>, or proper ability to <strong>filter out <em>“irrelevant” incoming sensory stimuli</em></strong> for perceptions</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A brief mechanism for excitation and inhibition is as follows:</p>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201015163338966.png" alt="image-20201015163338966" style="zoom: 80%;" /></p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>first notice that our cortex also have several layers, and in fact, the <strong>layer IV (4)</strong> is the layer that have <strong>neurons processes our sense</strong></li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Presynaptic neurons relay information to our <strong>thalamus</strong></li>
  <li>Postsynaptic neurons in our thalamus <strong>release GABA or Glutamate</strong> (or other neurotransmitters) that either <strong>inhibit the (action potential of) neurons in Layer IV, or (if produced Glutamate) to excite them</strong>.</li>
  <li>Cortical layer IV receive both excitatory inputs, and inhibitory inputs, and <strong>now starts to process our senses</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>In fact, one common <strong>example</strong> of the above mechanism would be:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Feedforward (bottom up) <em>inhibition</em></strong> is whereby a presynaptic neuron (such as a first order neuron for processing one of the senses) activates a postsynaptic neuron, such as a neuron in the thalamus; this postsynaptic neuron, when activated, will release molecules of the neurotransmitter <strong>GABA</strong>, the release of these molecules of GABA will help balance the inhibition/excitation of the next activated postsynaptic neuron (such as a neuron in cortical layer IV).</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>This <strong>feedforward (bottom up) inhibition</strong> is <strong>happening all the time in our brains</strong>. Neurons of the thalamus allow us to “gate” incoming sensory information so that this sensory information doesn’t overload us.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="example-phantom-limb">Example: Phantom Limb</h5>

<p>This is the phenomenon where people with amputated limbs are still able to “feel” its existence.</p>

<p>Experimentally, this has to do with <strong>feedforward inhibition:</strong></p>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201015164525332.png" alt="image-20201015164525332" style="zoom: 50%;" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>amputation of the first order neurons</strong> associated with the amputation of that limb</p>
  </li>
  <li>therefore, a group of <strong>postsynaptic neurons in the thalamus</strong> for these first order neurons <strong>are not activated</strong></li>
  <li>experiments have indicated that <strong>this group of postsynaptic neurons in the thalamus that are not activated are those that <em>release GABA</em></strong></li>
  <li>the <strong>lack of GABAergic inputs</strong> to the next postsynaptic neurons <strong>in cortical layer IV leads to increased excitation of the neurons specific for processing the cutaneous senses of the amputated limb</strong> in this cortical layer, hence the perception that the amputated limb is still intact</li>
</ol>

<h5 id="example-visual-afterimage">Example: Visual Afterimage</h5>

<p>This is the phenomenon where if you fixate your vision in the white dot of the first image for some time (e.g. 3 seconds), then by looking at the dot on the right, you will see an American flag</p>

<p>Again, it is the same <strong>feedforward inhibition:</strong></p>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201015164746185.png" alt="image-20201015164746185" style="zoom:67%;" /></p>

<p>This is because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>While fixating at a particular color, neurons for this particular color will <strong>“inhibit” release of GABA</strong>.</li>
  <li>This inhibition of GABA allows for the <strong>transient increase in the excitatory inputs to other neurons associated with another color</strong>, to give the transient perception of the visual afterimage.</li>
  <li>Now, when you switch back to the white image, <strong>the transient excitatory inputs of other colors will be more dominant</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>This means that, in general,</strong> our sense are <strong>by default very sensitive</strong>, and it is with GABA neurotransmitters that we have controlled our brain to <strong>operate on a normal level of sense</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="mirror-neurons">Mirror Neurons</h4>

<p>A <strong>mirror</strong> neuron is a neuron that fires/gets activated both when an animal/human acts (including emotions) and <strong>when the animal/human <em>observes</em> the same action (including emotions)</strong> performed by another.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>this means that <strong>for that action (including emotion), seeing and doing were the same!</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>not all neurons/actions have this property</li>
  <li>as you imaged, this is related to learning by imitation and the ability to <strong>empathize</strong> with others</li>

<p><strong>Gestalt perception</strong>: understand psychological phenomena by <strong>viewing them as organized and structured wholes</strong> rather than the sum of their constituent parts.</p>

<ul>
  <li>e.g. understand cars are cars, but not as its individual parts such as some iron frames</li>
</ul>

<p>As a result, some common phenomenon related are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>gestalt principle of proximity</strong></li>
  <li><strong>gestalt principle of continuity</strong></li>
  <li><strong>gestalt principle of closure</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>which implicitly means that <strong>brains/neurons</strong> are <strong>more preferred to visual clues that are proximate, and/or continuous, and/or closed</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="learning">Learning</h2>

<p><mark>(Reading: Chapter 6)</mark></p>

<p>Learning can be generally defined as the <strong>acquisition of cognitive and behavior information</strong>.</p>

<p>In general, there are four types of learning:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>non-associative learning</strong>: Responding after repeated exposure to a single stimulus, or event
    <ul>
      <li><strong>habituation</strong>: A decrease in behavioral response after repeated exposure to a stimulus.</li>
      <li>for example: if you moved to a new house, the rumble of passing trains might disturb your sleep. <strong><em>After you live in the house for a while, you quit waking up to the sound of trains.</em></strong> This action, non-associative learning, is a <strong>learnt response to something in the environment</strong>. The change in response to the stimulus is a form of learning.</li>
      <li><strong>sensitization</strong>: When our behavioral response to a stimulus increases</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>associative learning</strong>: Linking two stimuli, or events, that occur together.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>conditioning</strong></li>
      <li>basically, understanding how stimuli, or events, are related.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>observational learning:</strong> Acquiring or changing a behavior after exposure to another individual performing that behavior.
    <ul>
      <li>For example, you might learn the steps to a new type of dance by watching a YouTube video. By <strong>watching</strong> others in person or in the media, people may <strong>learn what to appreciate or what to fear</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="non-associative-learning">Non-associative Learning</h2>

<p>In general, there are two types:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>habituation</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>a <strong>decrease</strong> in behavioral response after repeated exposure to a stimulus.</li>
      <li>We tend to notice new things around us. If something is neither rewarding nor harmful, habituation leads us to ignore it.</li>
      <li>In general, repeated (but not forever) habituation trials <strong>can lead to a state of habituation that lasts several weeks</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>dishabituation</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>increase</strong> in a response <strong>because of a change in something familiar</strong> is dishabituation</li>
      <li>For instance, birds might stop singing when they detect a predator, such as a hawk. The <strong>absence of bird song (which is usually present) alerts other animals</strong>, such as squirrels, to potential danger.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>sensitization</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>an increase in behavioral response after exposure to a stimulus.</li>
      <li>the stimuli that most often lead to sensitization are those that are threatening or painful.
        <ul>
          <li>In general, sensitization leads to heightened responsiveness to other stimuli as well.</li>
          <li>For example, giving a strong electric shock to an aplysia’s tail leads to sensitization. Following the shock, <strong>a mild touch anywhere on the body will cause the aplysia to withdraw its gills</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mechanism-of-non-associative-learning">Mechanism of Non-associative Learning</h3>

<p>In simple terms, it is the <strong>alterations in the functioning of the synapse lead to habituation and sensitization</strong>. For both types of simple learning, presynaptic neurons alter their neurotransmitter release.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <strong>reduction in neurotransmitter release</strong> leads to <strong>habituation</strong>.</li>
  <li>An <strong>increase in neurotransmitter release</strong> leads to <strong>sensitization</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="associative-learning---conditioning">Associative Learning - Conditioning</h2>

<p>This is how we learn <strong>predictive associations</strong>, instead of those passive associations in habituation and sensitization.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For example, when you are thirty and lost in the forest, you listen for the <strong>sound of running water</strong> for finding <strong>water sources</strong>. Hence there is a predictive associations, such as between the sound of water and being able to find the water.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, this <strong>predictive association</strong> is learnt by <strong>conditioning</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Conditioning</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>the process of learning associations between a stimulus, and some type of response to that stimulus</li>
      <li>e.g. PTSD. Associate a scene (stimulus) to the feeling of horror (response).</li>
      <li>Within conditioning, there are two branches/types:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Classical Conditioning</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>two stimuli are linked</strong> together to produce a new learned response, which is usually <strong>involuntary</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>e.g. whenever you come home wearing a baseball cap, you take your child to the park to play. So, whenever your child sees you come home with a baseball cap, he is <em>excited</em> (learned response) because he has <em>associated your baseball cap with a trip to the park</em>.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Operant Conditioning</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>a method of learning that occurs through <strong>rewards and punishments</strong> for <strong>behavior</strong>, which is <strong>voluntary</strong> (hence you can voluntary stop it as well)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

<p>The above is a picture of the famous experiment, where a dog established a response (salivation) when hearing the researcher’s bell ring (stimulus), as usually the researcher feeds the dog (stimulus).</p>

<ul>
  <li>this is a great example because <strong>salivation</strong> is an <strong>autonomous response</strong>, that is <strong>involuntary for the dog</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>In general, you to train/pair two stimulus,</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>unconditional stimulus (UCS)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>one that unconditionally, naturally, and automatically triggers a response. (response takes place <strong><em>without any prior learning</em></strong>)</li>
      <li>e.g. food</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>unconditional response (UCR)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong><em>unlearned response that occurs naturally</em></strong> in reaction to the unconditioned stimulus.</li>
      <li>e.g. salivation due to food</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>neutral stimulus (NS)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>stimulus which <strong><em>initially (before conditioning) produces no specific response</em></strong> other than focusing attention</li>
      <li>e.g. bell ringing <em>before</em> paired with food</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>conditional stimulus (CS)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>substitute <strong><em>stimulus that triggers the same response</em></strong> in an organism as an unconditioned stimulus.</li>
      <li>e.g. bell ringing <em>after</em> paired with food</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>conditioned response (CR)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>an <strong><em>automatic response established by training</em></strong> to an ordinarily neutral stimulus.</li>
      <li>e.g. salivation due to bell ringing</li>
      <li>this could even include responses each as fear, which will be talked about in the section <a href="#Phobia and Addictions">Phobia and Addictions</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="acquisition-phase-during-classical-conditioning">Acquisition Phase during Classical Conditioning</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>During Acquisition Phase</strong>:  initial period of improvement. It covers that period of time from when the learner is unable to respond correctly without assistance through to when they are able to respond correctly without assistance.
    <ul>
      <li>effects affecting this stage could be:
        <ul>
          <li>frequency of neutral and unconditioned stimulus presented</li>
          <li>timing between the neutral and unconditioned stimulus</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>After Acquisition Phase</strong>: the conditional stimulus could elicit the conditioned response
    <ul>
      <li>however, often some other phenomenon happen as well:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>conditioned stimulus generalization</strong>, where a <strong><em>new</em></strong> neutral response, similar to the previous one, could also elicit the conditioned response.
            <ul>
              <li>e.g. a bell ringing at a different tone also produces the conditioned response</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>conditioned stimulus discrimination</strong>, animals learn to <strong><em>differentiate between two similar stimuli</em></strong> if one is consistently associated with the unconditioned stimulus and the other is not.
            <ul>
              <li>e.g. Pavlov and his students demonstrated that dogs can learn to make very fine distinctions between similar stimuli. For example, dogs can learn to detect subtle differences in tones of different frequencies</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>this is an important ability for us to detect poisonous plants</li>
          <li><strong>higher order conditioning</strong>, is the phenomenon by which a <strong><em>neutral stimulus precedes and is paired with a conditioned stimulus</em></strong> (which already gives a conditioned response). What ends up happening is that the <strong>neutral stimulus now becomes a second</strong>, usually weaker, <strong>conditioned stimulus</strong>.
            <ul>
              <li>e.g. a dog having been conditioned to salivate (CR) to the sound of a bell CS (assuming the bell became a CS by being paired with food). If you then <strong><em>pair a light (NS) with the bell (CS)</em></strong>, then the <strong><em>light will become a CS and the dog will salivate (CR)</em></strong> at the sight of the light.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Maintenance of CR</strong>: after successful acquisition, the <strong>conditioned response is continued</strong> when the <strong><em>conditioned stimulus (CS) is repeatedly presented/maintained with the unconditioned stimulus</em></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>e.g. continuing presenting food after the bell ring</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="timing-between-ns-and-ucs">Timing Between NS and UCS</h5>

<p>Usually, when you do experiments mentioned above, you will record timing between UCS and NS:</p>

<ul>
  <li>since you present the UCS after NS, time of UCS $&gt;$ NS.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201020033507627.png" alt="image-20201020033507627" style="zoom: 67%;" /></p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the x-axis can be simply understood as <strong>number of milliseconds <em>after</em> presentation of NS</strong> at which UCS is presented</li>
  <li>this basically says, that the <strong>ideal time interval for getting a response</strong> after acquisition would be about 300ms.
    <ul>
      <li>obviously, if you presented the UCS too fast, the <strong><em>response might not even have time to appear</em></strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-role-of-dopamine">The Role of Dopamine</h4>

<p>At this point, the <strong>key principle of associative learning is expectation and prediction</strong>. If a CS has been conditioned so that the organism expects/predicts the UCS (e.g. food) after the CS (e.g. bell), then conditioning is successful.</p>

<p>In effect, what happens in the brain during the above process:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <strong>dopamine activity</strong> in your brain changes according to the stimulus (i.e. like an autonomic response)
    <ul>
      <li>dopamine is involved in “addictive” behavior, especially in terms of <strong>increased wanting</strong> for the addictive substance.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the below is data from an experiment testing with monkeys</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201104133949036.png" alt="image-20201104133949036" style="zoom:50%;" /></p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(a) <strong>before conditioning</strong>, the monkey were happy/surprised (rise in dopamine activity) at the presentation of juice</li>
  <li>(b) <strong>after conditioning</strong>, the monkeys were <strong>happy at the presentation of light</strong>, but <strong>none at juice</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>because the <em>monkey has expected/predicted the juice</em> when they see the light, so the UCS was treated not as a “stimulus” in the brain anymore</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>(c) once the UCS no longer appeared after the CS, <strong>negative prediction error resulted in decreased dopamine activity</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>As the above talked about prediction errors, here are the definitions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Positive Prediction Error - after a stimulus appears, something better than expected (e.g. a reward) happens.
    <ul>
      <li>A positive prediction error <strong>strengthens the association between the CS and the US</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Negative Prediction Error - after a stimulus appears, the expected (e.g. reward) did not happen.
    <ul>
      <li>A negative prediction error <strong>weakens the association between the CS and the US</strong>.</li>
      <li>also means how you can “unlearn” the conditioning</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="phobia-and-addictions">Phobia and Addictions</h4>

<ul>
  <li>A <strong>phobia is an acquired fear</strong> that is out of proportion to the real threat of an object or of a situation
    <ul>
      <li>According to classical-conditioning theory, phobias <strong>develop through the <em>generalization</em> of a fear experience</strong></li>
      <li>e.g. when a person stung by a wasp develops a fear of all flying insects.</li>
      <li>e.g. for the experiment with little Albert: pairing of the CS (rat) and US (smashing sound) led to the rat’s producing a <strong>fear response (CR) on its own</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>the key difference later on is that you <strong>do <em>not</em> need the US to maintain the pairing</strong>. This is the case since <strong>you have ran away</strong>, your brain <strong><em>thought</em> that you have avoided the US = positive prediction</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Conditioning also play a role in drug addition (besides all the biology happening)
    <ul>
      <li>Conditioned drug effects are common and demonstrate conditioning’s power</li>
      <li>e.g. the <strong>smell of coffee</strong> can become a conditioned stimulus (CS). The smell alone can lead coffee drinkers to feel activated and aroused, <strong>as though they have actually consumed caffeine</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="unlearning-conditioning">Unlearning Conditioning</h4>

<p>Once conditioned, can the conditioned response be eliminated/unlearned?</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Extinction of CR</strong> - the <strong><em>gradual weakening and apparent disappearance of the conditioned response</em></strong> when the conditioned stimulus is repeatedly not presented with the unconditional stimulus
    <ul>
      <li>e.g. bell repeatedly not presented with food (negative prediction error)</li>
      <li>e.g. however, PTSD is cannot be unlearnt</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Spontaneous Recovery of CR</strong> - the phenomenon that after extinction of a CR, the <strong><em>immediate reappearance of the same CR</em></strong> (without the acquisition phase) due to the <strong>re-presentation of the original conditioned stimulus CS with the unconditioned stimulus</strong>.
    <ul>
      <li>e.g. after “unlearning” bell and food, once you re-presented bell and food again, the pairing <strong>might</strong> be recovered immediately.
        <ul>
          <li>then, if you pair that again, the pairing/conditioning comes back</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>In general, extinction can replace the associative bond, but it does not eliminate that bond (due to spontaneous recovery).</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="effectiveness-of-acquisitionmaintenanceextinction">Effectiveness of Acquisition/Maintenance/Extinction</h4>

<p>Below is, in one experiment, how the researcher designed three ways of pairing:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>strong (orange)</strong>: so that for $100\%$ of the time, NS or CS is presented with UCS</li>
  <li><strong>middle (blue):</strong> so that for $50\%$ of the time, NS or CS is presented with UCS</li>
  <li><strong>weak (red):</strong> so that for $25\%$ of the time, NS or CS is presented with UCS</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201022164151637.png" alt="image-20201022164151637" style="zoom:50%;" /></p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>each <strong>trial</strong> is composed of <strong>many attempts</strong>.</li>
  <li>in the acquisition phase, it seems that all three pairings were successful (all acquisition were successful) after the second trial (if the successful acquisition is defined as $50\%$ of the elicited response)
    <ul>
      <li>the <strong>threshold of successful acquisition</strong> is <strong>defined by the researcher</strong> him/herself</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>in the extinction phase, the <strong>stronger the pairing</strong>, the faster the rate of extinction</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="anatomical-changes-of-classical-conditioning">Anatomical Changes of Classical Conditioning</h4>

<p>Below discusses <strong>anatomical changes</strong> in the brain due to classical conditioning for different sense.</p>

<ul>
  <li>if a neuron is supposed to be activated by a specific chemical, but classical conditioning made it become activated due to other stimulus.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="gustatory-sense">Gustatory Sense</h5>

<p>For example, <strong>in terms of gustatory sense as UCR</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It is usually found that the <strong>Ventral tegmental area (VTA)</strong> are affected, as they are associated with emotion and the pleasure of food</p>

    <p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201022170202848.png" alt="image-20201022170202848" style="zoom: 67%;" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, if we record the activity of neurons in the VTA before the acquisition phase:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>here, we are pairing the flash of light with orange juice for a monkey</p>

        <p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201022170330529.png" alt="image-20201022170330529" style="zoom:50%;" /></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>activity of the same neuron in the VTA after acquisition:</p>

    <p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201022170418719.png" alt="image-20201022170418719" style="zoom:50%;" /></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="olfactory-sense">Olfactory Sense</h5>

<p>In a mice, the part that deals with smelling is the <strong>olfactory bulb</strong>. And <strong>acetophenone</strong> is an “pleasant” odorant that <strong>activates neurons in the olfactory bulb of the brain</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Now, if you are paring the acetophenone with foot-shocking for the mice, it is found that:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>after the acquisition phase, once <strong>acetophenone is presented</strong>, the mice did not feel pleasant but were <strong>“freezing” their body</strong></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>in fact, it is found that:</p>

        <p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201022171623259.png" alt="image-20201022171623259" style="zoom: 67%;" /></p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>more neurons now gets activated by acetophenone</strong> for the conditioned mice, <strong>some of which might be related to causing the “freezing”</strong> in the body</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="long-term-potentiation">Long Term Potentiation</h5>

<p><strong>Long</strong>-<strong>term potentiation</strong> (LTP) is a persistent increase in synaptic strength due to <strong>high-frequency stimulation of a chemical synapse</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>as as result, synapses that have undergone LTP tend to have <strong>stronger electrical responses</strong> to that stimuli than other synapses.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>during <strong>conditioning</strong>, this means <strong>LTP can result in synaptic plasticity</strong> (anatomical changes of neurons near the synaptic area)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an example would be <strong><em>neuron forming a new dendritic spine</em></strong> which would <strong><em>increase synaptic efficacy of that stimulus</em></strong></p>

  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>This also connects to how we form long term memory</strong> - learning and memory results from a <strong><em>forming/strengthening of synaptic connections between neurons that fire together</em></strong>.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>As the synapse between two neurons strengthens during consolidation, the two neurons become better connected, as though a freeway had been built between them.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="contemporary-views-of-classical-conditioning">Contemporary Views of Classical Conditioning</h4>

<p>In the above cases, <strong>two events/stimuli</strong> are presented in <strong>contiguity</strong> (i.e., together in time), and it would produce a learned association.</p>

<p>However, sometimes, classical conditioning tends to also choose its own <strong>neutral stimulus</strong>. (i.e. <strong><em>certain pairings of stimuli are more likely to become associated than others</em></strong>.)</p>

<ul>
  <li>for example:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Taste Aversion</strong> - a dislike for a particular food when an organism becomes ill <strong><em>hours after</em></strong> eating the food and that the exact <strong><em>cause for the illness is not clear</em></strong>
        <ul>
          <li>e.g.: A rat was offered two neutral stimuli: sugar water and many toys in a cage to play with</li>
          <li>then, after 24 hours, it is injected with a drug causing gastrointestinal distress</li>
          <li>finally, rat refused to drink the sugar water again, but still played with toys</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Biological Preparedness</strong> - animals are genetically programmed to <strong><em>fear specific objects</em></strong>.
        <ul>
          <li>e.g. Monkeys can more <strong>easily be conditioned to fear snakes</strong> than to <strong>fear objects such as flowers or rabbits</strong></li>
          <li>e.g. when <strong>people</strong> participate in conditioning experiments in which aversive stimuli are paired with members of their own racial group or members of a different racial group, they <strong>more easily associate the negative stimuli with “outgroup” members</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>This finding indicates that people are <em>predisposed to wariness of outgroup members</em>.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>this <strong><em>challenges the Pavlov’s principles of classical conditioning</em></strong>, in which you needed a <strong>defined time interval</strong> between <a href="#Timing Between NS and UCS">between NS and UCS</a>, and of course a <strong>clear causation relationship</strong> for pairing, because:
    <ul>
      <li>for food aversion, it is easy to produce conditioning with food (e.g. food + stomachache), but they are very <strong>difficult to produce with light or sound</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>From an evolutionary viewpoint</strong>, this makes sense because animals that quickly associate a certain taste with illness, and therefore avoid that taste, <strong>will be more successful</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>When doing classical conditioning, <strong>associations of a particular stimuli</strong> might be <strong>more likely to be paired</strong> with the autonomic response <strong>due to our innate disposition (hence relates to evolution theory)</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>e.g. if you got gastrointestinal distress, association is more likely to be formed with the food/drink NS</li>
      </ul>

<h3 id="learned-helplessness">Learned Helplessness</h3>

<p><strong>Learned helplessness</strong> is behavior exhibited by a subject after enduring repeated aversive (unpleasant) stimuli beyond their control. It was initially thought to be caused from the subject’s acceptance of their powerlessness: <strong>discontinuing attempts to escape or avoid (giving up)</strong> the aversive stimulus, <strong><em>even when such alternatives are unambiguously presented</em></strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For example: A child who performs poorly on math tests and assignments will quickly begin to feel that <strong>nothing he does will have any effect on his math performance</strong>. When later faced with any type of math-related task, <strong><em>even the ones he is fully capable of</em></strong>, he may experience a sense of helplessness and fail.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="operant-conditioning">Operant Conditioning</h3>

<p><strong>Classical conditioning</strong> is a relatively <strong><em>passive and automatic process</em></strong>. Through classical conditioning, an animal learns predictive associations between stimuli, <strong>regardless of the animal’s behavior</strong>.</p>

<p>Operant conditioning is the learning process in which an <strong>action’s <em>consequences</em></strong> <strong>determine the likelihood of that action being repeated</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The idea here is that that animals operate on their environments <strong>to produce effects</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, in operant conditioning, the human or animal makes <strong><em>associations between behavior and events</em></strong> that <strong><em>it can control</em></strong>. By contrast, in classical conditioning, the association is made between events that cannot be controlled.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A method of learning that occurs through <strong>rewards and punishments</strong> for <strong>behavior</strong>, which is <strong>voluntary</strong> (hence you can voluntary stop it as well).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Law of Effect</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Before the term operant conditioning, this is what it is called: (by Edward Thorndike):
      <ul>
        <li>within an environment, when a <strong><em>voluntary</em> behavior produces satisfying effects</strong>, this will likely occur again in the same environment, and vice versa for voluntary behavior producing a non-satisfying effect.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Later, this term becomes what is known now: operant conditioning.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="learning-through-reinforcement">Learning Through Reinforcement</h4>

<p>Basically, Thorndike hypothesize that operant conditioning works by having a <strong>reinforcer</strong> - a stimulus (reward/punishment) that occurs after a response and <strong>increases the likelihood that the response will be repeated</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Positive reinforcement - <strong><em>giving some reward</em></strong> to the subject when they <strong>perform the desired action</strong> so they associate the action with the reward and <strong>do it more often</strong>. The <strong><em>reward is a positively reinforcing stimulus</em></strong>.</li>
  <li>Negative reinforcement - <strong><em>avoiding/removing some punishments</em></strong> when they <strong>perform the desired action</strong> so they associate the action with the “reward” and <strong>do it more often</strong>. The <strong><em>punishment is a negatively reinforcing stimulus</em></strong>.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Notice:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>In both cases, <strong>both reinforcement increases the likelihood of behavior being repeated.</strong></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Positive punishment- <strong><em>giving some punishment</em></strong> to the subject when they <strong>perform the desired action</strong> so they associate the action with the punishment and <strong>do it less often</strong>. The <strong><em>punishment is a negatively reinforcing stimulus</em></strong>.</li>
  <li>Negative punishment- <strong><em>avoiding/removing some reward</em></strong> to the subject when they <strong>perform the desired action</strong> so they associate the action with the “punishment” and <strong>do it less often</strong>. The <strong><em>reward is a positively reinforcing stimulus</em></strong>.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Notice:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>In both cases, <strong>both reinforcement decreases the likelihood of behavior being repeated.</strong></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Caveats in Using Punishment for Operant Conditioning</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Research has shown that for <strong>punishment to be effective</strong>, it <strong>must be reasonable</strong>, unpleasant, and <strong>applied immediately</strong> so that the relationship between the unwanted behavior and the punishment is clear.
      <ul>
        <li>this is to avoid considerable potential for <strong>confusion</strong></li>
        <li>e.g. if a student is punished after <strong>admitting</strong> to cheating on an exam, the student may then associate the punishment with being honest (for admitting) rather than with the original offense. As a result, the student <strong>learns not to tell the truth</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="operant-conditioning-experiment">Operant Conditioning Experiment</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Operant Chamber/Skinner Box</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>A box designed by Skinner, so that you can <strong>experimentally measure the relationship between operant (voluntary behaviors) and the consequences</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201027164411249.png" alt="image-20201027164411249" style="zoom:67%;" /></p>

<p>Using this setting, for animals, we can make them <strong>acquire or maintain their voluntary behaviors</strong> during operant conditioning, via any of the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fixed-Ratio Schedule
    <ul>
      <li>reinforcement should be delivered <strong>after a constant or “fixed” number of correct responses</strong>.
        <ul>
          <li><strong><em>For example</em></strong>, a fixed ratio schedule of 2 means reinforcement is delivered after every 2 correct responses.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Variable-Ratio Schedule
    <ul>
      <li>the delivery of reinforcement will “vary” but must <strong>average out</strong> at a specific number. Just like a fixed-ratio schedule, a variable-ratio schedule can be any number but must be defined.
        <ul>
          <li><strong><em>For example</em></strong>, a teacher following a “VR2” schedule of reinforcement might give reinforcement <strong><em>after 1 correct response, then after 3 more correct responses</em></strong>, then 2 more, then 1 more and finally after 3 more correct responses.</li>
          <li>Hence, overall there were a total of 10 correct responses (1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 10), reinforcement was delivered 5 times and so reinforcement was delivered for every 2 correct responses <strong>on average</strong> (10 ÷ 5 = 2)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Fixed-Interval Schedule (FI)
    <ul>
      <li>A fixed-interval schedule means that reinforcement (reward/punishment) becomes available <strong>after a specific period of time</strong>.
        <ul>
          <li>this means that the reinforcement only becomes available to be delivered and would <strong>only be given if the target behavior is emitted at some stage <em>after</em> the time interval</strong> has ended.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Variable-Interval Schedule (VI)
    <ul>
      <li>Similar to the above, it refers to time periods that must pass before reinforcement becomes available. However, the <strong>time period will “vary” but must average out at a specific time period</strong>. Again the time interval can be any number but must be defined.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Partial-reinforcement extinction effect</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Interestingly, ** according to experiments, **behavior</strong> under <strong>partial reinforcement (variable-ratio/interval schedule) persists longer</strong> than under continuous (fixed-ratio/interval schedule) reinforcement.
      <ul>
        <li>Makes sense because during continuous reinforcement, the learner can <em>easily detect when reinforcement has stopped.</em></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="shaping">Shaping</h4>

<p>Sometime, during an experiment above, rather than wait for the animal to spontaneously perform the desired action, you can use an operant-conditioning technique called <strong>shaping</strong> to teach the animal to do so.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Shaping</strong>: The technique that consists of <strong><em>reinforcing behaviors that are increasingly similar</em></strong> to the desired behavior.
    <ul>
      <li>e.g. Suppose you are trying to teach your dog to roll over. You initially reward any behavior that even slightly resembles rolling over, such as lying down. Once this behavior is established, you reinforce behaviors more selectively. <em>Reinforcing successive approximations eventually produces the desired behavior</em>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The key aspect to make shaping work is</strong> that animal learns to <strong>discriminate which behavior is being reinforced</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="superstitions">Superstitions</h4>

<p>Using operant conditioning theory, superstition can be understood as the follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Some random actions were <strong>accidentally reinforced</strong> by a desirable output, which actually just occurred by chance.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The tendency to associate events that occur together in time is incredibly strong <strong>because the brain is compelled to figure things out</strong>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>e.g. wearing a “good luck sock” during an exam, and getting a good score</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Aware of the tendency to associate events with other events that occur at the same time, it means you should <strong>distinguish yourself whether the timing was simply a coincidence,</strong> and then “risk” wearing different socks to your next exam!</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="primary-and-secondary-reinforcer">Primary and Secondary Reinforcer</h4>

<p>Basically, there are <strong>two categories of reinforce (rewards)</strong> that are used in operant conditioning:</p>

<ul>
  <li>primary reinforcers - food or water, because they <strong>satisfy biological needs</strong>.
    <ul>
      <li>therefore, if given those stimulus/reward, we would operant associate our behavior</li>
      <li>Biologically, this make sense because animals that repeatedly perform behaviors reinforced by food or water are <strong>more likely to survive and pass along their genes</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>secondary reinforces - Stimuli that serve as reinforcers but <strong>do not satisfy biological needs</strong>.
    <ul>
      <li>e.g. money, A for paper</li>
      <li>therefore, if given those stimulus/reward, we <strong>technically need to first associated the reward to the primary reinforcer</strong>. Then, we would operant associate our behavior.</li>
      <li>e.g. since money (CS) represent/associates food, security, power (UCS), which are primary reinforces, money as a reinforcer work, but as a secondary reinforcer</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="reinforcer-potency">Reinforcer Potency</h4>

<p>Some reinforcer (reward) are more powerful than others, and below would be a way to determine show potent a reinforcer is.</p>

<ul>
  <li>in short, you would want your operant conditioning to use a potent reinforcer</li>
</ul>

<p>Psychologist David Premack theorized one measurement of <strong>measuring a reinforcer’s value</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <strong>amount of time</strong> a person, when free to do anything, <strong>willingly engages in a specific behavior</strong> associated with the reinforcer.
    <ul>
      <li>e.g. most children would choose to <em>spend more time eating ice cream</em> than eating spinach. Ice cream is therefore more reinforcing for children than spinach is.
        <ul>
          <li>therefore, if you use ice cream as a reward to be given in your experiment, it will be more effective than giving a spinach</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>however, two things need to be taken care of in this method
        <ul>
          <li>reinforcer’s value can vary with context. (e.g. if you are full, and given ice cream)</li>
          <li>reinforcer’s value can vary with different people (e.g. an adult might prefer eating spinach)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>One important application of the above is the <strong>Premack principle</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Premark Principle</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>a <strong>more-valued activity</strong> can be used to <strong>reinforce</strong> the performance of a <strong>less-valued</strong> activity.
      <ul>
        <li>e.g. Parents use the Premack principle all the time. They tell their children, “Eat your spinach and then you’ll get dessert,” “Finish your homework and then you can go out,” and so on.</li>
        <li>this means it will not be effective if you attempt to reinforce a behavior by something that is less-valued</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="application-of-operant-conditioning-in-real-life">Application of Operant Conditioning in Real Life</h4>

<p>One useful case if for <strong>behavior modification</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>remove unwanted behaviors and replace them with desirable ones</li>
</ul>

<p>To do this, consider the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Identify</strong> a behavior you wish to change</li>
  <li><strong>Set</strong> goals.
    <ul>
      <li>Set goals that are realistic, specific, and measurable</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Monitor</strong> your behavior.
    <ul>
      <li>Monitor your behavior for a week or more <strong>before you begin making changes</strong>.</li>
      <li>You will use this baseline as a <strong>point of comparison</strong> later to assess your progress.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Select</strong> a positive reinforcer and decide on a reinforcement schedule
    <ul>
      <li>pick something attainable that you genuinely find enjoyable</li>
      <li>e.g. a movie each week that you meet your goal</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Reinforce</strong> the desired behavior.
    <ul>
      <li>To cause the behavior change you want to see, you need to reinforce the desired behavior <strong>whenever it occurs</strong></li>
      <li>e.g. This also means, if you do <strong>not</strong> work out at the gym three times this week (your goal), do <strong>not</strong> watch Grey’s Anatomy (your reinforcer).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Modify your goals, reinforcements, or reinforcement schedules, as needed.
    <ul>
      <li>Once you begin consistently hitting your stated goals, make the <strong>goals more challenging</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="contemporary-view-of-operant-conditioning">Contemporary View of Operant Conditioning</h4>

<p>In reality, however, <strong>reinforcement schedules explain only a certain amount</strong> of human behavior. Biology constrains learning, and reinforcement does not always have to be present for learning to take place.</p>

<h5 id="biological-constraint">Biological Constraint</h5>

<p>For instance, animals have a hard time learning behaviors that run <strong>counter to their evolutionary adaptation</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For example: pigeons can be trained to peck at keys to obtain food or secondary reinforcers, but it is difficult to train them to peck at keys to avoid electric shock. They can learn to avoid shock by flapping their wings, because wing flapping is their natural means of escape.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>The psychologist Robert Bolles (1970) has argued that animals have built-in defense reactions to threatening stimuli. <strong>Conditioning is most effective</strong> when the association between the response and the reinforcement is <strong>similar to the animal’s built-in predispositions.</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>similar to the aspect discussed in <a href="#Contemporary Views of Classical Conditioning">Contemporary Views of Classical Conditioning</a></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="latent-and-insight-learning">Latent and Insight Learning</h5>

<p>Namely, sometimes learning can take place <strong><em>without reinforcement</em></strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cognitive Maps/Latent Learning</strong></p>

    <p>Basically, during the acquisition phase via the methods mentioned above, even if the subject/animal did not behave what you wanted, it might still be <strong>learning it cognitively</strong>.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Latent Learning</strong> - during acquisition of learning, cognitive maps are being formed, but they took place <strong><em>without reinforcement</em></strong>
        <ul>
          <li>hints at <strong><em>observational learning</em></strong></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong><em>For example:</em></strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Consider three groups of mice in a maze:</p>

        <p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201027170640896.png" alt="image-20201027170640896" style="zoom: 50%;" /></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>and we see that for Group 3, the huge drop in the amount of errors they have means they <strong>might have learnt something extra as compared to the other groups, but have <em>not demonstrated in their behavior</em></strong></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Insight Learning</strong>.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>For example, during a problem solving, a solution <strong>suddenly emerges</strong> after either a period of inaction or contemplation of the problem.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-role-of-dopamine-in-operant-conditioning">The Role of Dopamine In Operant Conditioning</h4>

<p>Similar to classical conditioning, the neurotransmitter dopamine here also plays a big role.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In operant conditioning, <strong>dopamine release sets the value of a reinforcer</strong>. Drugs that block dopamine’s effects disrupt operant conditioning.</li>
  <li>Therefore, you could use this fact to:
    <ul>
      <li>Use <strong>drugs that enhance dopamine activation</strong>, such as cocaine and amphetamines, to <strong>increase the reward value of stimuli</strong>.</li>
      <li>this is biologically like this. For instance <strong>food tastes better</strong> when you are hungry, and <strong>water is more rewarding</strong> when you are thirsty, because <strong>more dopamine is released under deprived conditions</strong> than under nondeprived conditions (i.e. <strong><em>the more you want it, the better you feel when you get it</em></strong>).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The above comes with an edge case: sometimes, wanting occurs without liking.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>even in this case, the object might have been conditioned with a primary reinforcer in one way or another, hence becomes rewarding.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="week-8">Week 8</h1>

<h2 id="observational-learning">Observational Learning</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Learning</strong> that occurs through <strong>observing</strong> the behavior of others, <strong><em>including the consequences</em></strong>. <strong>As a result, you acquire or modify your behavior due to such an exposure.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>For example:</em></strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Consider three groups of kid, each <strong>watching</strong> a version of a film:
    <ol>
      <li>Adults punching Bobo doll, and given snacks and toys afterwards</li>
      <li>Adults punching Bobo doll, and being scolded afterwards</li>
      <li>Adults punching Bobo doll, and nothing happens afterwards</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>As a result:
    <ul>
      <li>kids after watching film 1 are more likely act aggressively to the Bobo doll</li>
      <li>kids after watching film 2 are less likely act aggressively to the Bobo doll</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This is also means a form of <strong><em>latent learning</em></strong>, as all the <strong>kids are just watching</strong>, yet learnt the behavior latently.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A related fact would be: watching violence would generally increase the children’s aggressiveness. This could be explained as they are <strong>desensitized to violence</strong> (<a href="#Non-associative Learning">Non-associative Learning</a>), showing fewer helping behaviors and increased aggression</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="modeling">Modeling</h3>

<p>The <strong>imitation of observed behavior</strong> is called modeling. The term indicates that people are reproducing the behaviors of models-those being observed.</p>

<p>However, modeling in humans is <strong>influenced by numerous factors</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201104154147834.png" alt="image-20201104154147834" style="zoom: 50%;" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>the most <strong>obvious ones</strong> would be: we tend to model actions of <strong>models who are attractive, have high status, and are somewhat similar to ourselves</strong>.
    <ul>
      <li>In addition, modeling is <strong>effective only if the observer is physically capable of imitating the behavior</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="vicarious-learning">Vicarious Learning</h3>

<ul>
  <li>whether observers imitate a model is whether the model is reinforced for performing the behavior.</li>
  <li>e.g. the adult punching Bobo doll example</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Difference between Observational/Associative Learning</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>It all about the difference between acquisition of a behavior and its performance. Here, <strong>all</strong> the children <strong>acquired</strong> the behavior. But only those who saw the model being rewarded <strong>performed</strong> the behavior.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="learning-fear-through-observation">Learning Fear Through Observation</h3>

<p>People and animals are capable of learning to fear particular things simply by <strong>seeing/hearing that the things are dangerous</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>this also has a biological constraint to it, so that you can be <strong>made easily fear things</strong> that you are biologically prepared to fear</li>
  <li>e.g. monkeys can learn <strong>fear for snakes</strong> by <strong>watching other monkeys being fearful</strong>. They observationally learn this quickly because they are biologically programmed to learn to fear snakes
    <ul>
      <li>however, you cannot easily make them fear flowers, for instance</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="memory">Memory</h2>

<p><strong>Memory</strong> - the abilities associated with <strong>encoding, storage (including consolidation), retrieving/recalling</strong> cognitive information, sensory information and sensorimotor information.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>encoding phase occurs at the time of learning</strong>, as information is transformed encoding into a format that can be stored in memory</li>
  <li><strong>storage phase is the retention of the encoded representation</strong>. That is, a <strong><em>change in your nervous system</em></strong> registers what you just experienced, retaining it as a memorable event.
    <ul>
      <li>During the change, your neural connections that support memory become stronger, and <strong><em>new synapses are constructed</em></strong>. This neural process is known as <strong>consolidation</strong>. Through consolidation, encoded information becomes stored in memory.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>retrieving stage consists of reaching into memory to find and bring to mind</strong> a previously encoded and stored memory when it is needed.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Reconsolidation of Memory</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Basically, it is the theory that once memories are activated, they <strong>need to be consolidated again to be stored back in memory</strong>. These processes are known as <strong>reconsolidation.</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>think of this image: A librarian returns a book to a shelf for storage so that it can be taken out again later</li>
        <li>This means our <strong><em>memory might change when we “use” them</em></strong>, such as when they are changed by our mood, knowledge about the world, or beliefs.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Reconsolidation <strong>happens each time a memory is activated and placed back in storage</strong>, and it may explain <strong><em>why our memories for events can change over time</em></strong></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>In general, you can imagine our memory system similar to that of a computer:</p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>you start with <strong>sensory inputs</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>sometimes, the term working memory is used instead of short term memory</li>
  <li><strong>before recalling information, you tend to retrieve them to your STM</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>this also means you recall information technically from STM</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sensory-memory">Sensory Memory</h2>

<p>A very <strong>brief memory</strong> that allows people to <strong>retain impressions of sensory information</strong> after the original stimulus has ceased.</p>

<p>It is often thought of as the first stage of memory that involves <strong>registering a tremendous amount of information about the environment,</strong> but only for a very brief period.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>e.g. <em>look at something and quickly glance away, you can briefly picture the image and recall some of its details</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One thing to note here is that, (for example) during our vision processing for reaching into sensory memory, we are also able to <strong>simultaneously process other sense as well</strong> (e.g. audition).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Remember that our sensory systems <strong>transduce</strong>, or change, that information into neural impulses.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>So everything we remember from sensory is just the result of <strong>neurons firing in the brain</strong></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks to sensory memory, when you turn your head, the scene passes smoothly in front of you rather than in jerky bits. Your <strong><em>memory retains information just long enough for you to connect one image with the next in a smooth way</em></strong> that corresponds to the way objects move in the real world.</p>

<h2 id="short-term-memory">Short Term Memory</h2>

<p><strong>To reach STM</strong> from <strong>sensory memory</strong>, we need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pre-attention
    <ul>
      <li>the ability of <strong><em>detection of a certain stimulus precede focused attention</em></strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>subconscious accumulation of information from the environment</strong>. All available information is pre-attentively processed.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>which leads to sensory gating
    <ul>
      <li>Then, the brain filters and processes what is important. Information that has the highest salience (a stimulus that stands out the most) or relevance to what a person is thinking about is <strong>selected for further and more complete analysis by conscious (attentive) processing</strong></li>
      <li>sometimes also referred to as selective attention</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>which leads to STM
    <ul>
      <li>in which Information <strong>remains for about 20 to 30 seconds</strong>. It then disappears unless you actively prevent that from happening (e.g. via consolidation)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>For example:</em></strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>suppose you see a flash of picture, on which there are some blue dots but only one red dot.
    <ul>
      <li>your brain hasn’t let you focus on this, so all the below processing would be subconscious</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>your pre-attention ability will detect some blue and the red dot on the picture, and pass it to your brain</li>
  <li>your sensory gate will filter out some irrelevant information, maybe things like how red the red dot is</li>
  <li>finally, at least some information after your gating will come into your STM, in which you might <strong>recall that you see a red dot</strong></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Similar to sensory memory, researchers learned that short-term memory is <strong>not a single storage system</strong>. Instead, it is an active processing unit that <strong>deals with multiple types of information</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="prepulse-inhibition">Prepulse Inhibition</h3>

<p>This could be potentially a way of <strong>measuring the strength of our STM</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Prepulse inhibition</strong> (<strong>PPI</strong>) is a neurological phenomenon in which a <strong>weaker prestimulus (prepulse) <em>inhibits</em> the reaction of an organism to a subsequent strong reflex-eliciting stimulus (pulse)</strong>, often using the startle reflex.</p>

<ul>
  <li>startle response: defensive sensorimotor response due to a sudden, intensive response</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>For example</em></strong></p>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201027175759861.png" alt="image-20201027175759861" style="zoom: 50%;" /></p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <strong>length of time from your prepulse to the actual pulse</strong>, such that you <strong>receive a reduced response</strong>, will be indicative of your ability of STM
    <ul>
      <li>if after a long time, you send a pulse, and you get a startle response, that means your STM forgot the prepulse</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>However, the ability to have <strong>prepulse inhibition</strong> vary, such that:</p>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201027180526464.png" alt="image-20201027180526464" style="zoom: 50%;" /></p>

<p>which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it suggests that people diagnosed with schizophrenia tend to have less inhibition if pre-pulse comes <strong>too early</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sensory-gating">Sensory Gating</h3>

<p>It is basically related to our ability of selective attention:</p>

<ul>
  <li>process of <strong>directing our awareness to relevant stimuli while ignoring irrelevant stimuli</strong> in the environment.
    <ul>
      <li><strong><em>For example</em></strong>: the <strong>cocktail party effect</strong> is the phenomenon of the <strong>brain’s ability to focus one’s auditory attention</strong> (an effect of selective attention in the brain) <strong>on a particular stimulus while filtering out a range of other stimuli</strong>, as when a partygoer can <strong><em>focus on a single conversation in a noisy room</em></strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="short-term-memory-span-and-chunking">Short Term Memory Span and Chunking</h3>

<p>STM is the mental process that enables us to <strong>temporarily recall cognition</strong>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Why do new items in our STM interfere with old items that was there?
    <ul>
      <li>this is mainly due to the duration/capacity of STM being limited (could be <strong>as few as four items</strong>)</li>
      <li>in general, <strong>limit</strong> is generally seven items (plus or minus two), and this figure is referred to as <strong>memory span</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But sometimes, we are able to hold more “items” than our memory span.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>e.g. remember the word <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BCPHDNYUMAUCLABAMIT</code> as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BC</code>,<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PHD</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NYU</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MA</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UCLA</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BA</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MIT</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>this is because of the phenomena of <strong>chunking</strong> - process of breaking down information into meaningful units. The <strong><em>more efficiently you chunk information, the more you can remember</em></strong>.</li>
      <li>in short, organization makes them much easier to recall</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="long-term-memory">Long Term Memory</h2>

<p>In the computer analogy presented earlier in this chapter, long-term memory is like the storage of information on a hard drive.</p>

<ul>
  <li>however, LTM in human is actually more powerful, as it is <strong>nearly limitless</strong>!</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <strong>LTM</strong>, as compared to STM, <strong>has a longer duration, and it has a far greater capacity</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="distinguishing-ltm-and-stm">Distinguishing LTM and STM</h3>

<p>Besides capacity and duration, there is an interesting <strong>phenomenon that can help distinguish the two</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>serial position effect</strong>, where you tend to recall the <em>earliest and the latest items</em> in a list the best, but worst at the middle</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201105135932346.png" alt="image-20201105135932346" style="zoom:50%;" /></p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This effect actually consists of two separate effects:
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>primacy effect</strong> refers to the better memory that people have for items <strong>presented at the beginning of the list</strong>.
        <ul>
          <li>this is actually because people tend to <strong>rehearse (consolidate) the earliest information</strong> (to LTM)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The <strong>recency effect</strong> refers to the better memory that people have for the <strong>most recent items</strong>, the ones at the end of the list
        <ul>
          <li>this is because they are <strong>still in our short-term memory</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>This means <strong>delay</strong> between the presentation of the list and the <strong>recall task</strong> could interfere with <strong>only recency effect</strong> (as they are in STM), but not with primary effect.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Still, the <strong>two memory systems (STM and LTM) are highly interdependent</strong>, at least for most of us. For instance, to chunk information in working memory, people need to form meaningful connections based on information stored in long-term memory.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="encoding-long-term-memory">Encoding Long Term Memory</h3>

<p>Basically, short term memory gets <strong>encoded</strong> to become long term memory</p>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201029145231437.png" alt="image-20201029145231437" /></p>

<p>where <strong><em>encoding processes</em></strong> for STM to LTM include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>maintenance</strong> - simply repeating the item over and over.
    <ul>
      <li>i.e. hard-coding the information into LTM</li>
      <li>this is not very efficient in general</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>elaboration</strong> - process by which one cognitively <strong>applies meaning</strong> to the information by <strong>linking it to knowledge from long-term memory</strong>.
    <ul>
      <li>i.e. adding elaboration information to an encoding</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>organization</strong> - the process by which one cognitively applies individual objects as one meaningful item, rather than as separate items, to this encoding
    <ul>
      <li>i.e. adding organizational information to an encoding</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>In short, if you want to store the information in LTM, you need to <strong>store it in a way that enables you to retrieve it later</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In general, the <strong><em>more deeply an item is encoded, the more meaning it has</em></strong> and the <strong><em>better it is remembered</em></strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>such an encoded information is sometimes also known as a <strong>mental representation</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Then, the <strong><em>actual encoding/storing mechanism</em></strong> is the:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>consolidation</strong> - the process by which labile (unstable) LTM is converted to stable LTM (the actual encoding)
    <ul>
      <li>i.e. actually encoding/storing the information</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="elaboration">Elaboration</h4>

<p>Elaboration is the process  that <strong>involves changing or adding to material, or making associations</strong> to make <strong>remembering a material easier.</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>For example:</em></strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>If you are given a <strong>list of words to remember</strong>, and you used the following three ways to do it:
    <ul>
      <li>only looking at the words</li>
      <li>listening to the pronunciations of the words</li>
      <li>making personal meaning of the words</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In the end, it terms out that after <strong><em>2 weeks</em></strong> (hence LTM), participants making meaning of them recalled the most words</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="organization">Organization</h4>

<p>Organization is the process by which one cognitively applies individual objects as one meaningful item, rather than as separate items, to the encoding.</p>

<ul>
  <li>As a result, by <strong>forming connections on the organization of the items, it makes the content more memorable.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>For example:</em></strong></p>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201029150116814.png" alt="image-20201029150116814" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>would be easier to remember by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MD</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PHD</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RSVP</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CEO</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IHOP</code>, and trying to associate each organization.</li>
  <li>this is essentially the idea of <strong>chunking</strong> information as discussed before</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="schemas">Schemas</h5>

<p>One important question here is: how do our brain decide <strong>how to chunk</strong>?</p>

<p>Decisions about how to chunk information depend on <strong>schemas</strong> - <strong>cognitive structures in long-term memory</strong> that help us perceive, organize, process, and use information.</p>

<ul>
  <li>schemas guide our attention to an environment’s relevant features, and <strong>provide structures/context for understanding events in the world</strong>.</li>
  <li><em>e.g.</em> you have a schema for grocery shopping at markets in the United States. That schema most likely includes shopping carts, abundant choices, and set prices. You may expect to choose your own fruit and vegetables in the produce section</li>
</ul>

<p>However, this also means <strong>schemas can <em>bias</em> how information is encoded</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>This bias occurs in part because <strong>culture</strong> heavily influences schemas</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="consolidation">Consolidation</h4>

<p>Consolidation is the process of converting of <strong>labile LTM/STM to stable LTM</strong>, thus <strong><em>encoding stable LTM</em></strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>for example, converting the previous sequence of words into stable LTM</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>In fact, as you will see in the section of **<a href="#Explicit/Implicit LTM">Explicit/Implicit LTM</a>, hippocampus is actually for encoding **explicit LTM</strong>. Implicit LTM will be intact if hippocampus is removed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anatomically:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Labile LTM</strong> generally involves <strong>neural activity within the hippocampus</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Stable LTM</strong> generally involves <strong>neural activity within the frontal lobe</strong> (one part of the frontal lobe is the prefrontal cortex)</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201029151120660.png" alt="image-20201029151120660" /></p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consolidation would mean converting information from your hippocampus to your frontal lobe</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

  <ul class="task-list">
    <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />However, there can be <strong>many different ways of consolidating</strong> the information.
      <ul>
        <li>One simple way would be to revisit the content regularly.</li>
        <li>Another more efficient way includes <strong>practicing retrieval</strong></li>
        <li>Rehearsal is a way to get some information into long-term memory, but simply repeating something many times is not a good method for making information memorable</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />It also means that, the <strong>removal of hippocampus means the lost of ability of encoding STM to LTM.</strong> This means you cannot encode <strong><em>new</em></strong> LTM.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="anatomical-changes-for-long-term-memory">Anatomical Changes for Long Term Memory</h3>

<p>What happens in the brain when a memory has been consolidated to be long term?</p>

<p>In short, the answer is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>long-term storage of information results from the <strong>development of new synaptic connections between neurons</strong>. In other words, memory <strong>involves the creation of neural circuits</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="long-term-potentiation---ltm">Long Term Potentiation - LTM</h4>

<p>This has been addressed in the associative learning chapter (see <a href="#Long Term Potentiation">Long Term Potentiation</a>), and it certainly also works here.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Long-term potentiation (LTP) is <strong>strengthening of a synaptic connection, making the <em>postsynaptic</em> neurons more <em>easily</em> <em>activated</em> by presynaptic neurons</strong>.
    <ul>
      <li>LTP serves as a model of how neural plasticity might underlie memory (and learning)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201105124413083.png" alt="image-20201105124413083" style="zoom:50%;" /></p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>As the synapse between two neurons strengthens during consolidation, the <strong>two neurons become better connected</strong>, as though a freeway had been built between them.
    <ul>
      <li>i.e. consolidation $\iff$ intense and frequent pulses in stage (2)</li>
      <li>i.e. established LTM $\iff$ two neurons being better connected in stage (3)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="detailed-mechanism-behind-ltp">Detailed Mechanism Behind LTP</h4>

<p>A critical player in LTP is the NMDA receptor on the postsynaptic neuron, which is basically a glutamate receptor.</p>

<p>And this is what happens:</p>

<ul>
  <li>LTP leads to an <strong>increase in the number of glutamate receptors</strong> on the postsynaptic neuron</li>
  <li>which <strong>increases its responsivity</strong> to glutamate released by the presynaptic neuron.
    <ul>
      <li>It can also produce more synapses between neurons.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>it means the postsynaptic neuron is <strong>more easily activated</strong> by the presynaptic neuron</li>
  <li>So it is <strong>strengthening synaptic connections</strong> among networks of neurons</li>
</ul>

<p><mark>ASK: I thought it should only strengthen particular synaptic connections</mark></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Extension: Drug that could Improve LTM</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Research shows that blocking HDAC (histone deacetylases, an enzyme) leads to increased memory.</li>
    <li>The general idea is that <strong>HDAC serves as a molecular “brake”,</strong> which has to be released from the molecule for memory to occur. However, unless something critical happens in the environment, <strong>the molecular brake is on and nothing is stored in memory</strong>.
      <ul>
        <li>This means drugs that block (turn off) HDAC lead to increased LTP. (e.g. drug that activate NMDA receptors)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="long-term-potentiation-via-genes">Long Term Potentiation via Genes</h4>

<p>In short, the idea is that a gene (which has the ability to control everything going on in a cell) could also be notified to establish connections between two neurons:</p>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201110011531491.png" alt="image-20201110011531491" style="zoom: 80%;" /></p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It starts by the phase of acquisition of new information, where <strong>serotonin molecules goes to bind to receptors</strong> embedded in the dendrites of the postsynaptic neuron to <strong>open the receptor to allow an influx of Na+</strong>.</li>
  <li>This triggers the <strong>CRE</strong> on the gene, which is a <strong>transcribing factor</strong> for telling the gene which part associated with LTP to transcribe</li>
  <li>The triggering will usually cause the transcription of a gene called <strong>ubiquitin hydrolase</strong>, which is highly <strong>implicated for LTM</strong>. Therefore, this ubiquitin pathway is implicated for the <strong>formation of “memory neurons”.</strong></li>
  <li>As a result, <strong>the binding of serotonin to its receptor of this neuron is no longer needed</strong> because there is persistent activation of PKA for the expression of the ubiquitin pathway</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="anatomical-regions-for-lt-memory">Anatomical Regions for LT Memory</h4>

<p>We know that hippocampus is for encoding new explicit LTM, but <strong>where is our LTM stored (where does LTP happen)</strong>?</p>

<p>In short, it turns out the storage of memory is distributed among our brain:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>temporal lobes</strong> are important for being able to say what you remember</li>
  <li><strong>cerebellum</strong> is involved in memory for motor actions</li>
  <li>visual information is stored in the <strong>cortical areas involved in visual perception</strong></li>
  <li>…etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201105131025926.png" alt="image-20201105131025926" style="zoom: 50%;" /></p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the role of <strong>medial temporal lobe</strong> is to form links, or pointers, between the different storage sites (e.g. vision and audition), and it direct/<strong>help</strong> the gradual <strong><em>strengthening of the connections between these links</em></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Once the connections are strengthened sufficiently through consolidation, medial temporal lobes become less important for memory</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Overall:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>memory is distributed among different brain regions</strong>. Memory does not “live” in one part of the brain</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="dementia-and-alzheimers-disease">Dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease</h5>

<p>Both relates to deficits in one’s STM, and one’s LTM.</p>

<ul>
  <li>This means that the <strong>neuroactivity of the temporal lobe</strong> are <strong>significantly reduced</strong></li>
  <li>As well as some other storages for LTM and STM</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201110012048965.png" alt="image-20201110012048965" /></p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>blue part indicates active neuroactivity</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="retrieving-long-term-memory">Retrieving Long Term Memory</h3>

<p>Basically, this is the reverse process of encoding.</p>

<p>Retrieval is cognitively accessing one’s LTM to STM, demonstrated by recall.</p>

<p>To understand how retrieval works, <strong>we need to first understand how memory is stored</strong> on a high level</p>

<h4 id="association-network-in-ltm">Association Network in LTM</h4>

<p>This is a <strong>high level model</strong> of explaining how LTM works. For <strong>biological details, go to the section</strong> <a href="#Anatomical Changes for Long Term Memory">Anatomical Changes for Long Term Memory</a></p>

<p>This model is called <strong><em>spreading activation model</em></strong>, and the idea is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>memory organization is based on <strong>networks of associations</strong>.</li>
  <li>an item’s distinctive features are linked so as to identify the item</li>
  <li>each unit of information (e.g. distinctive feature) is a <strong>node</strong></li>
  <li>The resulting network is like the <strong>linked neurons (nodes)</strong> in your brain, but nodes are simply bits of information.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201105143403210.png" alt="image-20201105143403210" style="zoom:50%;" /></p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An important <strong>feature</strong> of this mode is that activating one node <strong>increases the likelihood that <em>closely associated nodes</em> will also be activated</strong> (see <a href="#Long Term Potentiation - LTM">Long Term Potentiation - LTM</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="retrieval-cues">Retrieval Cues</h4>

<p>A retrieval cue can be <strong>anything that helps a person (or a nonhuman animal) recall a memory</strong></p>

<p>The idea behind retrieval cues is the <strong>encoding specificity principle</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any stimulus encoded <strong><em>along with an experience</em></strong> can later trigger a memory of the experience</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of retrieval cues include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>retrieval cues in <strong>context-dependent memory</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>this refers to memory being most easily recalled when <strong><em>recall situation is similar to the encoding situation</em></strong></li>
      <li>e.g. studied something in a specific room, and <strong>recall in the same specific room</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>retrieval cues in <strong>prospective memory</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>prospective memory is future oriented memory</li>
      <li>For example, seeing Juan might automatically trigger your memory (which was to <strong>bring a message to Juan - future oriented memory</strong>), so you effortlessly remember to give him the message</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>mnemonics</strong> as retrieval cues
    <ul>
      <li>learning aids or <strong>strategies</strong> that use retrieval cues to <strong>improve recall</strong>.</li>
      <li><em>e.g. memory palace</em>, this mnemonic consists of associating items you want to remember with physical locations.</li>
      <li><em>e.g. associate</em> your classmates’ names with the <em>items or parts you have visualized</em>. You might picture Justin climbing on your dresser, Malia sitting on a chair, and Anthony hiding under the bed. When you later need to remember the names, you would <em>visualize your room and retrieve the information associated</em> with each piece of furniture</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="study-technique-using-retrieval-cues">Study Technique Using Retrieval Cues</h4>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Elaborate the material</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>think about how the word is <strong>relevant</strong> to you. For example, you see the word rain and think, “My car once broke down in the middle of a torrential rainstorm.”</li>
      <li>Think about the meaning of the material and how the concepts are <strong>related</strong> to other concepts.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Practice retrieval</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>practice retrieving the information you are trying to learn.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Use <strong>verbal mnemonics</strong> for <strong>rote memory</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>learn long lists of items, but <strong><em>understanding the items doesn’t matter</em></strong>. In these cases, <strong>verbal mnemonics can help</strong>.</li>
      <li><em>e.g.</em> students have long used <em>acronyms to remember information</em>, such as HOMES to remember the great lakes (Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, and Superior)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Use <strong>visual imagery</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>a mental image of material may help you. Visual imagery strategies include doodling a sketch to help you link ideas to images</li>

<h4 id="temp">Temp</h4>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Association by contiguity</strong> - when a LTM is retrieved, another continual and contextual LTM will also most likely be retrieved
    <ul>
      <li>e.g. recalling the position of a spoon, also recalled the position for a knife</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Association by similarity</strong> - LTM can be linked, despite whether one has personal experience with this linking

<h4 id="biological-basis-of-ltm">Biological Basis of LTM</h4>

<h2 id="long-term-memory-systems">Long Term Memory Systems</h2>

<p>Basically, we see long-term memory as <strong>composed of several interacting systems</strong>. These systems share a common function: to retain and use information. However, they encode and <strong><em>store different types of information in different ways</em></strong></p>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201105151509206.png" alt="image-20201105151509206" style="zoom: 67%;" /></p>

<h3 id="explicitimplicit-ltm">Explicit/Implicit LTM</h3>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201029155958470.png" alt="image-20201029155958470" style="zoom: 80%;" /></p>

<p>The two broad category of LTM can be classified as</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>explicit (declarative) LTM</strong> - memory that needs <strong><em>conscious retrieval</em></strong> of cognition <strong><em>from LTM</em></strong> (i.e. we can explain why we know this)
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>episodic LTM</strong> - the conscious retrieval of <strong>specific events, situations, and experience</strong>, from your stable LTM.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>semantic LTM</strong> – the conscious retrieval of <strong>“factual” cognition</strong> (ideas and concepts that are not drawn from personal experience) from stable LTM</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>implicit (non-declarative) LTM</strong> - memory that supports <strong><em>unconscious retrieval</em></strong> of cognition <strong><em>from LTM</em></strong> (i.e. we cannot explain why we know)
    <ul>
      <li><strong>procedural memory</strong> – the unconscious retrieval of the <strong>performance of tasks</strong> (knowing how to do things) from stable LTM
        <ul>
          <li>involves motor skills, habits, and other behaviors</li>
          <li>e.g. mirror tracing (tracing a pattern while looking at a mirror)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>emotional memory</strong> – the unconscious retrieval of <strong>experiences that evoked an emotional reaction</strong> from stable LTM</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="week-9">Week 9</h1>

<h2 id="flaws-of-ltm">Flaws of LTM</h2>

<p>We forget far more than we remember. You might also have memories that are false, such as remembering a particular person was in a film when she wasn’t or getting plot details wrong.</p>

<p>In short, human <strong>long-term memory systems provide <em>less-than-accurate</em> portrayals of past events</strong></p>

<h3 id="forgetting">Forgetting</h3>

<p>You can say that forgetting is an inability to remember. However, normal forgetting helps us <strong><em>retain and use important information.</em></strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>on the contrary, if you could remember everything, you might experience a <strong><em>problem of recalling a specific thing</em></strong> among those memory</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, even if you think you have forgotten things, they are not completely gone in your brain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You may remember very little of the Spanish or calculus you took in high school, but relearning these subjects would take much less time and effort</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The difference between the original learning and relearning is called <strong>savings</strong>. In other words, you save time and effort because of what you remember.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In short, forgetting something <strong>could happen on various causes</strong>, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>memory decay</li>
  <li>blocking</li>
  <li>absent-mindedness</li>
  <li>amnesia</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="memory-decay">Memory Decay</h4>

<p>Memory decay involves forgetting overtime.</p>

<p>While you might think you forget because those are unused memories, most forgetting occurs because of <strong>interference from other information</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>proactive interference</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>old information</strong> inhibits the ability to <strong>remember new information.</strong></li>
      <li><strong><em>For instance</em></strong>, if you study for your psychology test, then switch to studying for your anthropology test, and then take the anthropology test, your performance on the test might be impaired by your knowledge about psychology</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>retroactive interference</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>new information</strong> inhibits the ability to <strong>remember old information</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong><em>For instance,</em></strong> when it comes time to take the psychology test, your performance might suffer because you recall the freshly reinforced anthropology material instead</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201109002939874.png" alt="image-20201109002939874" style="zoom:67%;" /></p>

<h4 id="blocking">Blocking</h4>

<p>e.g. you “blank” on some lines when acting in a play, and so on. Such temporary <strong>blockages</strong> are common and frustrating.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Blocking</strong> occurs when a person is <strong><em>temporarily</em> unable to remember some specific thing, but knows what it is about</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Blocking often occurs because of <strong>interference</strong> from words (for example) that are <strong>similar in some way</strong>, such as in sound or meaning, and that recur.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em>For example</em></strong>, you might repeatedly call an acquaintance Margaret although her name is Melanie.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="absent-mindedness">Absent-Mindedness</h4>

<p><strong>Absentmindedness</strong> is the <strong>shallow encoding</strong> of events. The major cause of absentmindedness is <strong>failing to pay attention</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em>For instance</em></strong>, you absentmindedly forget where you left your keys because when you put them down, you were also reaching to answer your phone.</li>
  <li><strong><em>e.g.</em></strong> recall that when prospective memory fails, you fail to remember to do something. Often, this form of absentmindedness occurs because you are caught up in another activity.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="amnesia">Amnesia</h4>

<p>Some people <strong>lose</strong> the ability to <strong><em>retrieve</em> vast quantities of information</strong> from long-term memory. This condition is called <strong>amnesia</strong>.</p>

<p>Usually, amnesia is caused by diseases or brain damage:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>anterograde</strong> <strong>amnesia</strong> – after damage to the brain (or surgery to remove part of the brain), there is <strong>decreased ability to encode <em>new</em> information from one’s STM to LTM</strong>, thus decreased ability to recall this type of cognition for one’s STM
    <ul>
      <li><strong><em>e.g.</em></strong> Patient H.M. removed his hippocampus, and caused this anterograde amnesia</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>retrograde</strong> <strong>amnesia</strong> – after damage to the brain (or surgery to remove part of the brain), there is <strong>decreased ability to retrieve from <em>stable/encoded, old</em> information in LTM</strong>, thus, decreased ability to recall this type of cognition for one’s STM</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="persistence">Persistence</h3>

<p>Brain not only have the flaw of forgetting things that you need, it also has the flaw of <strong><em>not</em> being able to forget things that you <em>want to forget</em></strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Persistence</strong> occurs when unwanted memories are remembered in spite of the desire not to have them.
    <ul>
      <li>e.g. PTSD</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="reducing-persistence">Reducing Persistence</h4>

<p>In short, the persistence memory are usually the fearful and traumatic ones. There has been three ways to deal with it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using the drug - <strong>propranolol</strong>: it blocks the postsynaptic receptors for the neurotransmitter norepinephrine.
    <ul>
      <li><strong><em>if given right before or after a traumatic experience</em></strong>, response for the hormonally enhance memories are reduced, and the effect lasts for months</li>
      <li>however, there might be side effects</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Using the technique - <strong>extinction</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>during the reconsolidation phase, use the technique of extinction</li>
      <li>no side effect</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Using <strong>HDAC inhibitors</strong>: they removes the molecular brakes on memory. As mentioned before, turning off HDAC improves LTP, hence could make <strong>reconsolidation powerful</strong> enough to erase old memories and <strong>replace it with a new (non-traumatic) version</strong>.
    <ul>
      <li>By inhibiting HDAC during the reconsolidation of a memory in a nonhuman animal, researchers were able to reduce an old conditioned fear response</li>
      <li>the problem with is approach is that it is too effective. Ethical concern on wiping/replacing  memory.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="memory-bias">Memory Bias</h3>

<p>This talks about the problem of your <strong>memory</strong> sometimes being <strong>wrong</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>changing of memories</strong> over time so that they become consistent with current beliefs or attitudes</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>This means that, often, people <strong><em>revise</em> their memories when they <em>change</em> attitudes and beliefs</strong>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>People also tend to remember events as casting them in prominent roles or <strong>favorable lights.</strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>hence the <strong>problem of eyewitness testimony</strong> that confirms their beliefs, instead of what actually happened</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>e.g. they might remember certain types of people are more likely to commit crimes and therefore might be more likely to identify people with those characteristics as the likely criminal</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="flashbulb-memories">Flashbulb Memories</h4>

<p>A <strong>flashbulb memory</strong> is a highly detailed, exceptionally <strong>vivid ‘snapshot’ of the moment</strong> and circumstances in which a piece of surprising and consequential (or emotionally arousing) news was learned about.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Although flashbulb memories are not perfectly accurate, they <strong>are at least as accurate</strong> <strong>as memory for ordinary events</strong>. As mentioned earlier in this chapter, to the extent that <strong>emotion is associated with an event, it tends to be better remembered</strong></li>
  <li>The key takeaway is that: even though peoples’ memory/emotion/belief might change, <strong>what <em>does not seem to change</em></strong> is the extent to which people <strong><em>feel confident</em></strong> in their memories.
    <ul>
      <li>Indeed, people are more confident about their flashbulb memories than they are about their ordinary memories</li>
      <li>Explains why you are sometimes so confident but your memory is just wrong</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="source-misattributions">Source Misattributions</h3>

<p>This talks about memories being partially wrong, but for the important parts that might cause confusions.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Source misattribution</strong> occurs when people misremember the time, place, person, or <strong><em>circumstances/context involved with a memory</em></strong></li>
  <li><strong><em>e.g.</em></strong> you see an <em>online ad</em> for a way to learn French while you sleep. You probably will not believe the claims in the ad. Yet over time you might remember the promise content but fail to remember the source. Because the promise occurs to you without the obvious reason for rejecting it, you might <em>come to believe that people can learn French</em> <em>while sleeping, or you might at least wonder if it is possible.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>They are two forms of source misattributions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Source amnesia</strong> is a form of misattribution that occurs when a person has a memory for an event but <strong><em>cannot remember where he or she encountered the information</em></strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Cryptomnesia</strong> is the phenomenon that a person <strong><em>thinks he or she has come up with a new idea</em></strong>, but instead, the person has <strong><em>retrieved an old idea</em></strong> from memory and failed to attribute the idea to its proper source</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="suggestibility-biased-memory">Suggestibility Biased Memory</h3>

<p>This refers how our memory can be easily tweaked based on the technique of suggestibility.</p>

<ul>
  <li>people can <strong>develop biased memories when provided with misleading information</strong>, which is known as <strong>suggestibility</strong>.
    <ul>
      <li><strong><em>e.g.</em></strong> The different wordings of the questions <strong>altered</strong> the participants’ memories for the event.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are multiple ways to use the technique of <strong>suggestibility:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>According to the spreading activation model, related information <strong>produce overlapping patterns of brain activity</strong> in the very frontmost portion of the <strong>temporal lobe</strong>. Those activations could cause participant confusion on what was actually confused, as they are all overlapping.
    <ul>
      <li>therefore, you tend to best recall the main theme (overlapped part), instead of tracing back to recover each individual information</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="repressed-memories">Repressed Memories</h4>

<p>This basically talks about the problem of whether knowing a piece of memory being:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>repressed</strong> memory, and resurfaced just now</li>
  <li>memory that has been <strong>faked</strong> by suggestibility</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, both have happened, and it was a heated debate</p>

<h1 id="week-10">Week 10</h1>

<p><mark>MIND MAP CONTINUES FROM HERE</mark></p>

<h2 id="language">Language</h2>

<p><strong>Language</strong> is a <strong>system</strong> for the effective use of <strong><em>signals to convey meaning</em></strong> so that we can communicate with each other.</p>

<p>The system of language can be decomposed into:</p>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201109013644302.png" alt="image-20201109013644302" /></p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Phonemes</strong> – smallest units of sound recognizable as speech</li>
  <li><strong>Morphemes</strong> – phonemes are combined to make meaningful units of language
    <ul>
      <li>Each word consists of <strong>one or more morphemes</strong>. Besides the root of a word, morphemes including suffixes and prefixes.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>content morphemes</strong> - the root of the word, has a concrete meaning</li>
          <li><strong>function morphemes</strong> - the suffixes/prefixes</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong><em>e.g.</em></strong> consider the words frost, defrost. The root word, <em>frost</em>, is a (<em>content</em>) morpheme. The meaning of this morpheme is changed by adding the prefix <em>de</em>, which is <strong>also</strong> a (<em>function</em>) morpheme.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Syntax</strong> - system of rules that govern how words are <strong>combined</strong> into phrases and how phrases are <strong>combined</strong> to make sentences</li>
  <li><strong>Semantics</strong> - meaning of syntax (phrases and sentences)</li>
  <li><strong>Pragmatics</strong> - how meaning/semantics might be <strong>changed</strong> due to <strong>context or intent</strong>.
    <ul>
      <li>An example of pragmatics is how the <strong><em>same word can have different meanings in different settings</em></strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sounds-of-language">Sounds of Language</h3>

<p>This talks about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>how we are able to <strong>physically speak a language</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>First, it works by forcing <strong>air</strong> through the vocal cords, which causes <strong>vibration of mucous membranes</strong> (part of larynx), hence producing sound</li>
      <li>Then, vibrating air molecules passes from the vocal cords <strong>to the oral cavity</strong> (part of the mouth behind the teeth and above the tongue). There, <strong>jaw, lip, and tongue movements</strong> change the shape of the mouth and the flow of the air, <strong>further altering the sounds</strong> produced by the vocal cords.</li>
      <li><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201109163535013.png" alt="image-20201109163535013" /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how we are able to <strong>separate words in a phrase/sentence for parsing</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>since languages also <strong>differ in the patterns of morphemes</strong> within phrases (a <strong>waveform</strong>). Such patterns help us <strong>separate the words</strong> we hear in conversation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>once we separated the stream of waveforms into segments, we <strong>parse its meaning</strong></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>e.g. the waveform of “what do you mean?”:</p>

        <p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201109164002032.png" alt="image-20201109164002032" /></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="language-in-the-brain">Language in the Brain</h3>

<p>In short, this is where your brain processes and produce language:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>left hemisphere</strong> - this is the most important part of language</p>

    <ul>
      <li>where you <strong><em>produce and comprehend language</em></strong></li>
      <li><strong>Broca’s Area</strong> - used for producing a language
        <ul>
          <li><strong><em>without/damaging Broca’s Area</em></strong>, you will experience <strong>expressive aphasia</strong> (also called Broca’s aphasia), which interrupts their ability to speak. These individuals generally understand what is said to them, but they cannot form words or put one word together with another to form a phrase</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Wernicke’s Area</strong> - used for understanding/parsing a language (e.g. speaking)
        <ul>
          <li><strong><em>without/damaging Wernicke’s Area</em></strong>, you will experience <strong>receptive aphasia</strong> (also called Wernicke’s aphasia), in which they have trouble understanding the meaning of words. This means they are not able to parse incoming language <strong>neither</strong> produce language that makes sense</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201109015701674.png" alt="image-20201109015701674" style="zoom: 80%;" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>right hemisphere</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>less important but still important</li>
      <li>processing rhythms of speech, understanding metaphors</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="capacity-to-learn-a-language">Capacity to Learn a Language</h2>

<p>The first step of language acquisition (learning a language) involves starting to understand a language. But how do we <strong>parse</strong> the very language we are speaking?</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>surface structure</strong> - In language, the sound and order of words.</li>
  <li><strong>deep structure</strong> - In language, the <strong>implicit meanings of sentences</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>And the idea is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>people automatically and unconsciously <strong>transform surface structure to deep structure</strong> - the meaning being conveyed. In fact, people remember a sentence’s underlying meaning, not its surface structure.
    <ul>
      <li>also means when we generate a sentence, we might <em>start with generating the deep structure</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>All language must be governed by universal grammar. In other words, according to Chomsky, <strong>all languages are based on humans’ <em>innate knowledge</em> of a set</strong> <strong>of universal and specifically linguistic elements and relationships</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>e.g. All languages include similar elements, such as nouns and verbs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>According to Chomsky, humans are <strong>born with a <em>language acquisition device</em></strong>, which contains universal grammar. This hypothetical neurological structure in the brain enables all humans to come into the world prepared to learn any language</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many errors associated with language result from <strong>interpretative differences between the deep structure</strong> of a sentence, even if the surface structure is the same (same sentence).</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="bilingualism-versus-monolingualism">Bilingualism versus Monolingualism</h3>

<p>Would <strong>learning a new language</strong> <strong><em>hinder</em></strong> the ability/development of the native language?</p>

<ul>
  <li>In short, according to research recently, learning a second language <strong>increases the density of grey matter</strong> in the inferior parietal lobe of the brain, and this increase is <strong>correlated with</strong>: a) attained proficiency of the second language, b) the age of the second language acquisition.
    <ul>
      <li>increasing density of grey matter means <strong>less energy</strong> would be needed for a certain part of brain to do its job. Hence, this indicates the increased ability to
        <ul>
          <li>parallel processing</li>
          <li>serial processing</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>more proficient in second language means greater density in grey matter</li>
  <li>earlier acquisition of second language means greater density in grey matter</li>
</ul>

<p>What does it mean to be intelligent?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Henry Goddard invented “intelligence” tests for identifying “feebleminded” individuals, for sterilization processes

      <li>which means <strong>eugenics</strong> - belief that the human race can be improved by manipulating which people are allowed to breed (intelligent breeds with intelligent only)</li>
      <li>obviously, very <strong>unethical</strong></li>

<h3 id="applications-of-intelligence-tests">Applications of Intelligence Tests</h3>

<p>Used for detecting/assessing <strong>Intellectual Developmental Disability (IDD)</strong> (defined by the DSM V, where all the mental disorders are defined), or <strong>mental retardation</strong> as previous terminology in DSM IV, have evolved from their predecessors to <strong>include three key features</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>significantly subaverage intellectual functioning (<strong>IQ of 70 or below</strong>, allowing for measurement error)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>substantial <strong>impairments</strong> in <strong>adaptive functioning</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>onset</strong>(发病)  prior to adulthood</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="general-intelligence">General Intelligence</h3>

<p><strong>General intelligence</strong> involves “<strong>directive cognition</strong>”, means you can cognitively direct your thoughts towards your goals, for example.</p>

<p>Also, there are different types of intelligence as well:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>critical thinking</strong> – cognitions that evaluate evidence (Ellen Langer)
    <ul>
      <li>motivated to find the best solutions to tasks</li>
      <li>criticism - schools spend too much time getting students to give a single  correct answer in an imitative way</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>creative thinking</strong> – cognitions that are novel and unusual; unique solutions</li>
</ul>

<p>Excelling at one type of cognition is likely to excel in other types of cognition.</p>

<h3 id="factor-analysis-for-intelligence">Factor Analysis for Intelligence</h3>

<p>Then, there comes the idea that Intelligence is <strong>not necessarily “measured”</strong>, but rather, intelligence is based on <strong>performance on tasks</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Charles Spearman (early 1900’s) coined a statistical technique known as factor analysis, to help explain <strong>correlations</strong> between <strong>intelligence and performance</strong></li>
  <li>If intelligence is a <strong><em>single</em></strong>, general ability for performance, then there should be a strong, positive correlation between performance on <strong><em>all</em> tasks</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201110135810336.png" alt="image-20201110135810336" style="zoom: 50%;" /></p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Multi factor basis of intelligence</strong> – general intelligence requires a <strong><em>combination</em> of performance of <em>all</em> categorical abilities</strong>, and of all specific skills
    <ul>
      <li>But, just because someone has the highest performance on “solving logic problems”, this <strong>does <em>not</em> mean</strong> they also have the highest performance on “making legal arguments”</li>
    </ul>

<h2 id="human-development">Human Development</h2>

<p><strong>Human development</strong> can be defined as the orderly and sequential <strong>changes</strong> that occur with the passage of time as we evolve from <strong>conception to death</strong>. i.e. looking at <strong><em>changes</em></strong>, over the human life span, in physiology, <strong>cognition</strong>, <strong>emotion</strong>, and <strong>social behavior</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>studies how people grow, develop and adapt <strong>at different life stages</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>And in more details, this section studies:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Physical</strong> pattern of growth - changes in nervous systems</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cognitive</strong> pattern of growth - changes on information processing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Social</strong> pattern of growth - changes on interactions with self and others</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Note that these patterns of growth:</p>

<ul>
  <li>emphasize/assumes the “<strong>normal</strong>” processes or markers associated with aging and/or senescence
    <ul>
      <li>e.g. not considering the process of someone who got like a PTSD</li>
      <li>this also allows us to define what would be <strong>abnormal</strong> properties of human development</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>are all <strong>interrelated</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="abnormal-developments">Abnormal Developments</h3>

<p>The case of <strong>Gini</strong>, who has been captivated in her room for more than 10 years.</p>

<p>Her therefore strange behavior could be indicative of her abnormal brain development:</p>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201117170601600.png" alt="image-20201117170601600" style="zoom: 80%;" /></p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the process of pruning did not happen much</li>
  <li>little proliferation of neurons/dendrites</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="developmental-lifespans">Developmental Lifespans</h3>

<p>In short, we can divide the entire lifespans into the following stages:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Prenatal</strong>: (conception to birth)</li>
  <li><strong>Infancy/Toddlerhood</strong>: (until age 2)
    <ul>
      <li>rapid growth of brain/cognitive/physical capacity</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Early Childhood</strong>: (ages 3-6)</li>
  <li><strong>Middle Childhood</strong>: (ages 7-11)</li>
  <li><strong>Adolescences</strong>: (ages 12-18)
    <ul>
      <li>puberty</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Emerging Adulthood</strong>: (ages 19-25)
    <ul>
      <li>newly identified lifespan</li>
      <li>first transitioning into adulthood, where you take responsibilities of yourself</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Adulthood</strong>: (ages 26-65)</li>
  <li><strong>Late Adulthood</strong>: (ages 66 and over)</li>
</ul>

<p>And it is important that for each lifespan, there are <strong>key “developmental events”</strong> associated with them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Cellular <em>senescence</em></strong>:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The reason why we age and some of our cells stop functioning is because of telomere:</p>

      <p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201117171745892.png" alt="image-20201117171745892" style="zoom: 50%;" /></p>

      <p>where:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>every time when a cell divides, the tip of the chromosomes (<strong>telomere</strong>) gets shorter. Once <strong>telomere</strong> is depleted, the cell cannot function anymore.</li>
        <li>As a result, you age.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="common-experimental-methodologies">Common Experimental Methodologies</h3>

<p>Some common methodologies taken place in developmental psychology include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Longitudinal experimental methodology</strong> - data is collected <strong>over time</strong>, usually years, from the <strong>same</strong> group of individuals, as categorized by a cohort (group of individuals who have common characteristics such as <em>age</em>)
    <ul>
      <li>i.e. <strong><em>repeated</em></strong> observations of the same variables</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Cross sectional experimental methodology</strong> - data is collected <strong>instantly</strong> from a group of individuals, as categorized by a cohort.
    <ul>
      <li>i.e. a <strong><em>snapshot</em></strong> of a particular group of people at a given point in time.</li>
      <li>usually quicker than longitudinal methodology</li>
      <li>may not reflect time and culture of the participants/cohorts</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Cross sequential experimental methodology</strong> - data is collected <strong>over time</strong>, usually years, from <strong>different</strong> groups of individuals, as categorized by a cohort.
    <ul>
      <li>i.e. repeated observation and comparison of different variables</li>
      <li>e.g. two or more groups of individuals of different ages are directly compared over a period of time</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="lifespans">Lifespans</h2>

<h3 id="prenatal-lifespan">Prenatal Lifespan</h3>

<p>The key stages here include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Germinal Stage</strong> - conception to the end of 2nd week
    <ul>
      <li>formation of zygote</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Embryonic Stage</strong> - beginning of the 3rd week to end of 8th
    <ul>
      <li>formation of embryo</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Fetal Stage</strong> - beginning of 9th week to birth
    <ul>
      <li>formation of fetus</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="germinal-stage">Germinal Stage</h4>

<p>The important events here as basically:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fertilization</li>
  <li>mitosis</li>
  <li>implantation</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201117173233829.png" alt="image-20201117173233829" style="zoom:50%;" /></p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sperm penetrates the egg cell to form a fertilized <strong>zygote</strong></li>
  <li><strong>mitosis</strong> is the process of self-duplication</li>
  <li><strong>blastocyst</strong> is a structure formed in the early development of mammals.</li>
  <li><strong>implantation</strong> happens in the <strong>uterus</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="embryonic-stage">Embryonic Stage</h4>

<p>After the germinal stage, everything happens inside the <strong>uterus</strong>. Some key events here are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>rapidly developing CNS related structure, especially your brain</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201117173650721.png" alt="image-20201117173650721" style="zoom:50%;" /></p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>therefore, this is the stage that is most <strong>susceptible to toxins</strong>, due to the rapidly development of structures associated with CNS.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="fetal-stage">Fetal Stage</h4>

<p>As compared to the embryonic stage, here we are developing <strong>lateral structures</strong> of human body, such as limbs.</p>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201117173808630.png" alt="image-20201117173808630" style="zoom:50%;" /></p>

<h4 id="sexual-differentiation">Sexual Differentiation</h4>

<p><strong>Sexual differentiation</strong> is the process by which individual develop biological male bodies or female bodies</p>

<p>In terms of chromosomes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For the 23rd pair, we receive an $X$ chromosome from our father, and either an $X$ or a $Y$ from our mother.
    <ul>
      <li>Females have a pair of $X$ chromosomes (46, $XX$), whereas <strong>males</strong> have one $X$ and one $Y$ chromosomes (46, $XY$).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>As a result, during the first month of the prenatal lifespan, we develop our gonads: an organ that produces gametes; a testis or ovary.</li>
</ul>

<p>**However, **things can still go wrong:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Turner’s Syndrome:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Instead of a pair of chromosome, you have only one: $X$ instead of $XX$. This only occurs to biological females.
      <ul>
        <li>As a result, it causes a variety of medical and developmental problems, including short height, <strong>failure</strong> of the ovaries to develop and heart defects</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Classical Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>$XX$ with deficient <strong>enzyme</strong> that <strong><em>increases testosterone</em></strong> production during prenatal lifespans
      <ul>
        <li>as a result, development of <strong>both</strong> male and female <strong>gonads</strong></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Androgen Insensitive Syndrome</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>$XY$ with <strong>incapability</strong> of of producing functional testosterones receptors, or <strong>resistant</strong> to male hormones (called <strong>androgens</strong>)
      <ul>
        <li>As a result, the person has some or all of the physical traits of a <strong>woman</strong>, but the <strong>genetic</strong> makeup of a man.</li>

<p>Recall that this is birth to 2 years, and some key events are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Physical Patterns of Growth</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>generation of neurons in brain (approx. until 1 month)</li>
      <li>proliferation/pruning of dendrites (approx. until 2 years)</li>
    </ul>

  </li>
  <li><strong>Cognitive Patterns of Growth</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>infants can <strong>differentiate</strong> between different shapes
        <ol>
          <li>using <strong>habituation</strong>, such that infants should decrease their time on looking at something new as we present it many times</li>
          <li>then, using <strong>dishabituation</strong>, we show them a different card, such that their response/time looking at it will increase</li>
          <li>it must then be that they can <strong>differentiate</strong> between two different shapes as different stimuli</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Social Patterns of Growth</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Importance of <strong>contact</strong> for attachment, not only the need for survival</li>
      <li>contact for attachment has implications for both interpersonal traits, and intrapersonal traits
        <ul>
          <li>experimented using infants monkey being placed with a wired fake monkey providing milk + cloth fake monkey providing comfort</li>

    <p><strong>Cognitive Patterns of Growth</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Jean Piaget hypothesized that this is associated with <strong>preoperational</strong> stage (cannot think logically, but <strong>intuitively</strong>) of cognitive development.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>experiments on testing children on the knowledge of “conservation”</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>flawed, because no motivation <strong>+</strong> they are only given the choices of which one is more</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>reasonably <strong>good</strong> STM and LTM, and strong <strong>resistance</strong> of suggestibility</p>

        <ul>
          <li>experimented with making children experience a staged event of Mrs. Baker baking cookies</li>
          <li>then, they are asked questions to recall the situation, and <strong>suggestibility</strong> has been used to try to distort their memory</li>
          <li>as a result, it means early children are more <strong>resistant</strong> to “suggestibility biased memory”</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Social Patterns of Growth</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Lawrence Kohlberg first studied “moral development” in children, which helps understanding the social patterns of growth for early childhood children</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>children were already <strong>capable</strong> for <strong>moral reasoning</strong>, and in fact, it is mostly associated with the area of frontal lobe</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>experimented with giving children moral questions to answer</p>

            <ul>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>(new chapter)</p>

<p>A process that <strong>energizes</strong>, <strong>guides</strong>, and <strong>maintains</strong> behavior toward a <strong>goal</strong>.</p>

<p>And motivation has been identified to be associated with three “forces”:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>activation</strong> - <strong>initiation</strong> of the cognitive and behavioral processes for obtaining the motivated goal
    <ul>
      <li>e.g. bought new shoes for the upcoming marathon</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>persistence</strong> - <strong>continued</strong> cognitions and behavior to obtain and motivated goal, even in the face of obstacles</li>
  <li><strong>intensity</strong> - continued cognitions and behaviors, in relation to <strong>obtaining</strong> and motivated goal</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="need-hierarchy">Need Hierarchy</h3>

<p>Maslow believed that people want to reach their personal “self-actualization”.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Self-actualization</strong>: attainment of the motivated goal, at a <strong>state</strong> that is achieved when one’s personal dreams and aspirations have been <strong>attained</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Need</strong>: something that is vital, at a <strong>state</strong> of biological or social <strong>deficiency</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201119143747976.png" alt="image-20201119143747976" style="zoom:50%;" /></p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Maslow believed that people’s need goes from bottom to top in a <strong>dependency</strong> manner, such that without fulfilling basic needs, you won’t even think about psychological needs.</li>
  <li>Later research has shown, however, such a jump in needs could be possible for humans, i.e. needs are <strong>not hierarchical</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="basicbiological-needs">Basic/Biological Needs</h3>

<p>Motivations vital for <strong>survival</strong>.</p>

<p>Since our body strive for <strong>homeostasis</strong> (the state of steady internal, physical, and chemical conditions maintained by living systems), we need the following mechanisms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Thermoregulation</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>humans are <strong>endotherms</strong>, such that when we get hot, we generate sweat</li>
      <li>need of shelter</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fluid Regulation</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>cells in our body/cells prefer <strong>isotonicity</strong> for fluids inside our body
        <ul>
          <li><strong>isotonic</strong>:  solution having the <strong>same osmotic pressure</strong> as some other solution</li>
          <li>hypertonic:  solution having the lower osmotic pressure as some other solution</li>
          <li>hypotonic:  solution having the higher osmotic pressure as some other solution</li>
          <li>e.g. after eating a salty meal, we need to “neutralized” the extra salt</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Food Regulation</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>ghrelin</strong>: hormone synthesized and secreted by cells of stomach, and it is critical in serving us the feeling of <strong>hunger</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>synthesized ghrelin -&gt; ghrelin gets secreted by cells of stomach -&gt; ghrelin activates neurons in the brainstem -&gt; synapses onto neurons in hypothalamus -&gt; increase the synthesis of molecules associated with the <strong>feeling of hunger</strong></li>
          <li>why people feel like they need more food than another</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>leptin</strong>: hormone synthesized and secreted by white adipose tissue of the body, associated with the feeling of <strong>fullness</strong>/<strong>satiety</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>cells of white adipose tissue synthesize and secrete leptin -&gt; gets circulated and binds to leptin receptor of neurons in the brainstem -&gt; perception of <strong>satiety</strong></li>
          <li>why, after eating some food, you feel full/satiated</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="self-determination-theory-of-motivation">Self-Determination Theory of Motivation</h3>

<p>This theory suggests that people are able to become <strong><em>self</em>-<em>determined</em></strong> when their needs for <strong>competence</strong>, <strong>connection</strong>, and <strong>autonomy</strong> are fulfilled.</p>

<ul>
  <li>e.g. students want to get a degree for university are self-determined</li>
  <li>and that with the ability of being self-determined, we could <strong>jump</strong> from basic needs to <strong>self-fulfillment needs</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Consider the following experiment:</p>

  <li>participants were asked to play a game, in which they could either play it with:

      <li>continuously choosing the picture they chose at the beginning of the game (<strong>self-determined</strong>)</li>
      <li>continuously choosing the picture they were told to choose</li>

<h3 id="stanford-prison-experiment">Stanford Prison Experiment</h3>

<p>The aim of this experiment was to investigate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Why might people <strong><em>assigned</em></strong> to play the role of <strong>guards</strong> <strong>abuse</strong> those who are assigned to be <strong>prisoners</strong>?</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201124142852908.png" alt="image-20201124142852908" /></p>

<p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Healthy, male participants were recruited to participate in a 2-week <strong>prison simulation</strong></li>
  <li>Randomly assigned to the role of prisoner or prison guard</li>
  <li>Prison <strong>guards</strong> were provided wood batons and mirrored sunglasses to prevent eye contact. <strong>Prisoners</strong> were fingerprinted, photographed, strip searched and given a <strong>prisoner number</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Remember, the participants are all undergraduates of Stanford University.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Results</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Study ended after 6 days due to <strong>psychological impact</strong> of the situation on participants
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Prisoners</strong> became <strong>depressed</strong> and showed signs of trauma, launched a rebellion on the second day</li>
      <li><strong><em>Prison guards began to use force and harass prisoners</em></strong>, took away beds, toilet privileges, put some in solitary confinement</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hints at people <strong>changing behavior</strong> due to <strong>situation contexts</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later, this study has been criticized for ”methodology”:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Possible fraud</strong>: Zimbardo (main researcher) asked guards to exert control over prisoners, instead of letting them decide what to do</li>
  <li><strong>Demand characteristics</strong>: participants change behavior to fit their interpretation of experiment</li>
</ul>

<p>This comes from the idea that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Healthy, male participants were recruited through newspaper ads for a study at Yale University
    <ul>
      <li>this time, no college students were used</li>
    </ul>

  <li>Participants were <strong>paired</strong> with another person and drew lots so one would be assigned the <strong>‘learner’ and the other ‘teacher’</strong></li>
  <li>Participant was always selected to be the teacher, and learner was a <strong><em>confederate</em></strong> (person that is part of the research team pretending to be a participant)</li>
  <li>Told to <strong>give the learner an electric shock each time he made a mistake</strong>, increasing the shock level each time</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Milgram Study Results</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>65% of participants administered shock up to 450 volts, 100% administered shocks up to 300 volts</p>

    <ul>
      <li>All participants <strong>stopped the study at least once</strong>, but were urged to continue by the experimenter</li>
      <li>Participants experienced <strong>visible distress</strong> during study, as well as <strong>long-term stress</strong> as a result of participation

<h3 id="the-asch-experiments">The Asch Experiments</h3>

<p>The goal:</p>

<ul>
  <li>investigate the extent to which <strong>social pressure</strong> from a majority group could <strong>affect a person to conform</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201124150139321.png" alt="image-20201124150139321" style="zoom: 67%;" /></p>

<p><strong>Result:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Over the 12 critical trials, about 75% of participants conformed at least once, and 25% of participants never conformed.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Phenomenon’s in this experiment:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>conformity</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>changing</strong> one’s <strong>behavior</strong> or beliefs in response to <strong>explicit or implicit pressure</strong> (real
or imagined) from others.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>informational social influence</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>the influence of other people that results from <strong>taking their</strong>
<strong>comments or actions</strong> as a source of information about <strong>what is correct</strong>, proper, or effective.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>normative social influence</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>the influence of other people that comes from the <strong>desire to avoid their disapproval</strong>, harsh judgments, and other social sanctions (e.g. ostracism).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The take-away message is:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Why did the participants conform so readily? When they were interviewed after the experiment, most of them said that they did not really believe their conforming answers, but had gone along with the group for <strong>fear of being ridiculed or thought “peculiar”</strong>.
      <ul>
        <li>A few of them said that they really did believe the group’s answers were correct.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Apparently, people <strong>conform for two main reasons</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li>because they want to <strong>fit in</strong> with the group (normative influence)</li>
        <li>because they <strong>believe</strong> the <strong>group is better</strong> informed than they are (informational influence).</li>
      </ul>

<h4 id="factors-that-impact-conformity">Factors that impact conformity</h4>

  </li>
  <li><strong>Group unanimity</strong>: even if one person is with you instead of the group, result changes greatly
    <ul>
      <li>When <strong>all</strong> group members reported the <strong>wrong number</strong>, participants <strong>conformed ~30%</strong> of the time.</li>
      <li>When <strong>even one</strong> other person <strong>dissented from the majority</strong> (agrees with you), the participant conformed <strong>only 5%</strong> of the time!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Expertise and Status</strong>: When we assume others are experts or if they are higher status than we
are, we tend to conform more.</li>
  <li><strong>Culture</strong>: countries that are more interdependent (more on that next class!) have higher rates of conformity.</li>
  <li><strong>Anonymity</strong>: responding <strong>anonymously</strong> significantly <strong>reduces conformity</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="theories-of-emotion">Theories of Emotion</h3>

<p>Can we make someone feel happy/sad, or even feel attracted by us?</p>

<p>To find out, we need to study how our emotion arises:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Early Theories of Emotion</strong>: <strong>James-Lange</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>emotion is based on a physical arousal, hence is dependent on <strong>how you interpret</strong> the physiologically response</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>a stimulus -&gt; autonomic arousal -&gt; <strong>interpolates</strong> to an emotion</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>e.g. a bear -&gt; body shaking -&gt; means I <strong>should</strong> be afraid -&gt; afraid</p>

      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cannon-Bard Theory of Emotion</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>your response and your emotion should be <strong>simultaneous</strong>. It cannot be that one caused the other</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>there should be a central control signal: <strong>cerebral cortex</strong> that sends information to both</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>e.g.</p>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Schacter-Singer Two Factor Theory of Emotion</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>combination of both</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>a stimulus still leads to autonomic arousal first, but your emotion is <strong>dependent</strong> on your <strong>appraisal/cognitive label</strong></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>e.g. if you have <strong>labelled</strong> a particular <strong><em>response+stimulus</em></strong> as being “scary”, then you are scared, and vice versa.</p>

<p>Research question: can people <strong>misattribute</strong> the cause of their autonomic/physiological arousal?</p>

<ul>
  <li>e.g. in this experiment, participants are “tricked” into <strong><em>thinking their heart rate went up because of the female</em></strong> (<strong><em>rather than the bridge</em></strong>). As a result, feel “attracted” to the female.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Method</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Male participants were stopped by an attractive female confederate after <strong>crossing a sturdy or shaky bridge</strong> (in other replications- immediately after crossing the shaky bridge, or after they had time to get HR back at rest)</li>
  <li>The female confederate (blind to the study hypothesis) asked if they would be interested in participating in a study, provided her phone number if they have any further questions about the project</li>

      <li>can have multiple social identities</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Social identity is important</strong> because it can be used to explain intergroup behavior:</p>

  <li>divided the world into “them” and “us” based through a process of social categorization</li>

  <p><strong>Revision on schema</strong>:</p>

    <li>also helps us to <strong>save energy</strong> when thinking about things, as well as easier <strong>memory encoding</strong></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>However, remember that schemas can change/are shaped by:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Experiences</strong> with <strong>social</strong> environment</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, we can define <strong>Stereotype</strong> - mental <strong>representation</strong> of a <strong><em>social group and its members</em></strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>i.e., a type of <strong>schema</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Similar, related to stereotype are <strong>attitudes</strong> - <strong>evaluations people make</strong> about objects, ideas, events, or other people’s beliefs, feelings, predispositions to act in a certain way</p>

<ul>
  <li>i.e. a more <strong>evaluative schema</strong> (e.g. is X good or bad?)</li>
  <li>attitudes are <strong>accessible</strong> if they are <strong>easily retrieved</strong> from memory
    <ul>
      <li>Higher accessibility $\to$ <strong>stronger influence on behavior</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Explicit attitudes</strong>:

<p>Q: What makes talking about race difficult?</p>

<h4 id="color-blindness">Color-blindness</h4>

<p>Not about physical color blindness, but:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The idea that <strong>racial and ethnic group categories do not matter</strong>; we all have a superordinate identity and <strong>everyone should be judged as individuals equally</strong></p>

    <p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201201173740643.png" alt="image-20201201173740643" style="zoom:67%;" /></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This attempts to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ignoring and avoiding discussion of group categories altogether</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>However, study results show that:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>not all Americans agree with the statement of color-blindness</p>

    <p>where:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>horizontal bar means the percentage of people that agreed to the above statement, that all Americans are treated equally</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="color-blindness-as-a-strategy-to-avoid-race-discussion">Color-Blindness as a Strategy to Avoid Race Discussion</h5>

<p>The idea is simple: if I do not notice race, then I cannot be racist.</p>

<p>However, it turns out to <strong>not work</strong>, because <strong>racial categories are processed automatically</strong></p>

<p><strong>Experiment:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>measure <strong>event related brain potential (ERP)</strong> of a participant while looking at pictures of people with different race
    <ul>
      <li>ERP is like a brain’s electrophysiological response to a specific stimulus/event</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Result:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Our brain <strong>categorizes</strong> races <strong>automatically</strong></p>

<h4 id="colorblind-strategy-is-learned">Colorblind Strategy is Learned</h4>

<p>This talks about the fact that:</p>

<ul>

<ul>
  <li>for 8-9 year-old, they did not care much about race</li>
  <li>for 10-11 year-old, they <strong>attempts to not mention race</strong>

<h4 id="consequence-of-appearing-colorblind">Consequence of Appearing Colorblind</h4>

<p>Psychological threat for <strong>majority</strong></p>

  <li>Challenges self-image of <strong>being a good person</strong></li>
  <li>Acknowledging role of privilege and potential contribution to others’ disadvantage</li>
  <li>Challenges view of society as meritocratic</li>
</ul>

<p>Psychological and interpersonal threat for <strong>minority</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Means attending to <strong>racial injustices and microaggressions</strong></li>
  <li>Challenges view of society as meritocratic</li>

<h3 id="goal-mismatch-and-ambiguous-social-cues">Goal Mismatch and Ambiguous Social Cues</h3>

<p>It turns out that different group of people tend to have <strong>different goals</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>as a result, different group of people behaves differently</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>For example:</em></strong></p>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201201183847489.png" alt="image-20201201183847489" /></p>

<p>where, within a single conversation:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>white</strong> people want to be <strong>liked</strong> more than respected by the others</li>
  <li><strong>black</strong> people want to be <strong>respected</strong> more than liked by the others</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>A common phenomena happens here:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>A white person would want to smile more during a conversation (to be liked)</li>
    <li>A black person would perceive that as <strong><em>not respecting</em></strong> him/her, hence feels offended
      <ul>
        <li>due to goal mismatch</li>
      </ul>

  </li>
  <li>Distrust

  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mitigating Distrust:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Critical Feedback: I’m giving you these comments so that you’ll have feedback on your paper</li>

<h3 id="stress">Stress</h3>

<p>Before we talk about psychology disorders, we need to talk about <strong>stress</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Stress</strong>: the <strong><em>nonspecific responses</em></strong> of body <strong>compromising one’s ability</strong> to adapt to the posed threat
    <ul>
      <li>e.g. eat more/less undergo stress</li>
      <li>e.g. sleep less undergo stress</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Consider the hippocampus area of two monkeys, one <strong>under stress and one not</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201208134116434.png" alt="image-20201208134116434" style="zoom:50%;" /></p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>we see a microscopic slide of the <strong>hippocampus</strong> area
    <ul>
      <li>remember, hippocampus is part of the <strong>limbus system</strong>, and also part of the <strong>LTM</strong> encoding</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the <strong>black</strong> dots are the <strong>cell body areas</strong> (grey matter)
    <ul>
      <li><strong>more</strong> black dots <strong>in the middle if <em>not</em> under stress</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In particular, if we look closer at the above picture:</p>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201208135100494.png" alt="image-20201208135100494" style="zoom: 67%;" /></p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>monkey under stress has <strong>sparse neurons</strong></li>
  <li>monkey under stress has <strong>reduced number of nuclei of neurons</strong> (very black dots) in the hippocampus</li>
  <li>monkey under stress <strong>atrophied</strong> dendritic branches
    <ul>
      <li>decreased synaptic efficacy/communication</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>monkey under stress <strong>reduced synapses</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>decreased synaptic communication</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>However, stress is associated with</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>The activation of the pathway in the <strong>hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis</strong>, which may lead to <strong>inflammatory responses</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>this <strong>pathway</strong> is also related to <strong>causing trauma</strong></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="hpa-axis">HPA Axis</h4>

<p>Hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Neurons of the <strong>hypothalamus</strong> (subcortical) receives, and monitors, one’s <strong>information in the environment</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>recall that thalamus was responsible for receiving/forwarding sensory information</li>
      <li>hypothalamus part of the limbic system, hence related to emotional processing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If hypothalamus is <strong>activated due to stress</strong> from one’s environment, the <strong>corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH)</strong> is secreted/<strong>released</strong> from <strong>neurons</strong> of hypothalamus</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, those <strong>CRH</strong> then binds to receptors to <strong>activate</strong> neurons in the <strong>pituitary gland</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After that, neurons in <strong>pituitary gland</strong> secrete/<strong>release</strong> <strong>adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>pituitary gland is part of the brain, and it is called a “gland” because it <strong><em>releases hormone</em></strong></p>

        <p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201208141140304.png" alt="image-20201208141140304" style="zoom: 33%;" /></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those ACTH then circulates in bloodstream and <strong>bind</strong> to receptors in the cells of <strong>adrenal glands</strong>, so that those cells <strong>release glucocorticoid hormones (GC)</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>for instance, <strong>Cortisol</strong> is an example of glucocorticoid hormones</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The GC then circulates in the bloodstream and <strong>bind</strong> to receptors to receptors of <strong><em>potentially every biological cell</em></strong>, as long as that cell has a <strong>mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) or a glucocorticoid receptor (GR)</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The binding of GC to GR or MR will <strong>enhance</strong> transcription of <strong>genes</strong> that <strong>produce inflammatory processes</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>as a result, too much inflammation will <strong>kill many cells</strong> in your body</li>
      <li>therefore, since it <strong>depends on your own gene</strong>, the <strong>response</strong> you have for stress may be <strong>different than others</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Additionally:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The binding affinity of GC hormones are <strong>higher for MR</strong> than for GR in cells.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>As a result, it means:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>binding to the glucocorticoid receptor <strong>(GR) will enhance</strong> the transcription of genes that produce <strong>inflammatory</strong> processes
      <ul>
        <li>because, <strong>by default</strong>, those hormones are not binding to GR, and you should not be killing your cells</li>
        <li>as a result, those <strong>inflammatory</strong> responses are caused by <strong><em>chronical activation of the pathway</em></strong>, hence binding to GR</li>
        <li>so chronic stress is bad</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="general-adaptation-syndrome">General Adaptation Syndrome</h4>

<p>In general, a <strong>moderate</strong> level of stress -&gt; <strong>increase</strong> adaptation functioning/resilience -&gt; <strong>good</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>however, chronic stress will reduce adaptation functioning</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="\lectures\images\typora-user-images\image-20201208142826998.png" alt="image-20201208142826998" style="zoom: 67%;" /></p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>alarm stage</strong> -&gt; <strong>beginning of HPA axis</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>for example, <strong>alarm stage</strong> would be the stress you have when you got a <strong>pop quiz</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>resistance stage</strong> -&gt; GC hormone binding to <strong>mostly mineralocorticoid receptor MR</strong> + little GR of your body cells
    <ul>
      <li>of course, the binding affinity also depend on the number of receptors/cells you have in your body. The less there is, the less resistance you have/more probable that GR will be bonded</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>exhaustion stage</strong> -&gt; activation of glucocorticoid receptors <strong>GR</strong> of cells
    <ul>
      <li>causing both physical and mental exhaustion</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>this would be more like a <strong>long term trend for stress</strong></li>
    <li>short term stress would be related to <strong><em>sympathetic autonomic system</em></strong></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="trauma-and-resilience">Trauma and Resilience</h4>

<p><strong>Level 1 trauma center</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>highest level of surgical care to trauma patients</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Resilience</strong> is defined as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>stable trajectory to healthy functioning</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>data suggest that if you had a traumatic event, then the <strong>first symptom</strong> of post-trauma would <strong>appear within 0-7 years</strong></li>
      <li>so you need to have a <strong>stable trajectory over 7 years to be okay</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>assessment of resiliency would then use emotional scales, ratings on level of coping and confidence…</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Experiment:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>longitudinal study of <strong>psychological functioning</strong> of <strong>patient</strong> after a single traumatic stressor, and admittance to level 1 trauma center</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Result:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Presence of “human intention” during the traumatic stressor, this is associated with a <strong>lower</strong> of resiliency
    <ul>
      <li>e.g. being beaten</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Underestimating or overestimating the difficulty of coping immediately after the traumatic stressor, this is associated with a <strong>lower</strong> level of resiliency</li>
  <li>Higher anger and depressive level before the traumatic stressor, this is associated with <strong>lower</strong> level of resiliency</li>
  <li><strong>Increased</strong> education level indicated <strong>higher</strong> level of resiliency</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="what-is-psychological-disorder">What is Psychological Disorder</h3>

<p>To be a psychological disorder, we need to have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a set of <strong>abnormal cognitive</strong> symptoms <strong>and</strong></li>
  <li>a set of <strong>abnormal behavior</strong> symptoms</li>
  <li>so that it <strong><em>causes/potentially causes</em></strong> <strong>impairment</strong> in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning of <strong>oneself and/or others</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>for example, homosexuality would not impair oneself and/or others, so it should not be a disorder</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>In fact, the validated criteria for <strong>classification of psychological disorder</strong> is only done in <strong>1950</strong>’s, by the book called “<strong>American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)</strong>”</p>

  <ul>
    <li>current version is DSM-5</li>
    <li>but the DSM is heavily relied upon by clinicians, researchers, and etc.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>While the DSM is very powerful, it has some significant limitations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>absence/inference of biomarkers</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>many <strong>symptoms</strong> described on the book is <strong>subjective/inferred</strong>, namely, a physical description by a clinician on the patient or by the patient himself/herself
        <ul>
          <li>e.g. biomarkers would be understanding things from your blood sample, brain images, etc</li>
          <li>e.g. non-biomarkers would just be descriptions of symptoms</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
